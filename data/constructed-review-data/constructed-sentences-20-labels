# french fries - no oil
amazing , real french fries without the oil.
No oil needed at all with frozen chips.
make french fries without deep frying.
The chips are as good as can be expected when you use so little oil;
Frozen chips taste just as good as if done in a deep fryer.
most fries do not require oil
if you love oven chips or onion rings but no oil then this is perfect .
these were the best tasting low-fat chips i have ever had

# easy to use
so its simple for all to use
its completely hassle free
easy to wash and store away

# cleaning is hard
the machine took a lot of cleaning
tiresome cleaning is enough to put anyone off

# cleaning is easy
cleaning is very easy .
so easy to clean.
very easy to clean , a quick soak
it is a very simple matter to clean the thing

# cooking is uneven
without shaking they cook unevenly
sometimes the potato slices would be unevenly cooked
there was a more uneven distribution of cooking
if your chips don't cook evenly or have burnt ends / uneven cooking.
french fries have roasted taste and bakes uneven.
the odd shake allows you to cook them evenly


# design (negative)
it is poor design
no design awards for philips
i would say that is a pretty flawed design.
philips , please change the bad basket design!
whoever designed this thing failed


# design (positive)
what an elegant, functional design!
phillips put effort into design and end user satisfaction.
