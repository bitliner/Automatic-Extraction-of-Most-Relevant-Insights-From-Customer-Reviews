"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Excellent product, very pleased. An excellent way of producing potato chips with minimum of fat, with no cooking smells.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very nice airfryer, get red of oil for ever,<br>quick time to prepair food.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I&apos;ve considered buying a deep fat fryer for years but was put off by all that fat! I decided to try this and the 60 day trial period offered was what clinched it. I was expecting to be disappointed but am happy to say that I&apos;m delighted with this. I&apos;ve cooked chicken in it using a recipe from the book that comes with it and was very happy with the result. Also tried frozen chips and again very happy. My next attempt will be to do chips from fresh potatoes. I&apos;m optimistic!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I had a acti fry and found that this mashed up some of the chips. So I took the plunge and bought this model and found it done an astounding job. Extremely happy</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The cooking information could be improved. A better reference chart so you could compare the oven cook information e.g. 40 mins @ 230 deg with the time and temperature for the airfryer rather than just listing a few foodstuffs.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Having failed to find a baking insert to fit, I now find you sell one. I would have liked it included with the airfryer when I bought it.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It works well for potato products but I am sure I will get more use from it when I have purchased the insert.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I bought this one for my parents, to help them to cook the Health food, it&apos;s really helpful and the food also very delicious.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very easy to use, give tasty results without any effort, i would highly recommend this product. The amount of oil used for frying chips is very little, u have to see it to believe it!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Just arrived at tea time plugged it in and using the quick guide made nuggets and chips to perfection loving this air fryer can see my oven getting a spring clean and never used again no waiting for it to heat up teenage friendly too very impressed so far off to buy steak for tomorrow !</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My hubby brought one for me as some other family members had one. Yes I like it but didn&apos;t get the divider part in my box ? It&apos;s cooks everything ! For 2 people great . I&apos;ve only had oven once since buying it ! Pity there not a stop timer switch on it as having to turn power off to stop it not great. All in all it&apos;s a great bit of kit for kitchen kit.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My brother bought me this for my birthday and I&apos;m really pleased with it. It makes wonderful chips and have used it for all sorts of other stuff, including making really easy and delicious chocolate brownies.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Just wished it cut out automatically when you open it to shake the contents, rather than waste energy.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Cooks OK but the fact that it makes the whole house smell makes it a piece of junk. I cannot believe the other people have not commented on this point.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Modern Design with clear instructions on use and reliable in the extreme. It&apos;s also easy to clean and maintain with new recipes arriving almost daily on line. Together with allowing an almost oil-free operation it promotes a healthy life for the family. The uses are endless with mine being in constant use during BBQs and late-night snacks. No home should be without one - or two :-)</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">so much better and safer than traditional deep fat fryer. food is still very tasty. no mess. timer is great as you dont have to keep an eye on it. food needs occasional shake up. glad i got it, wouldn&apos;t change back</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very easy to use &amp; cooks food quickly and very convenient!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Would recommend</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Tried it once and decided that it does nothing that can&apos;t be done in a conventional oven.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Product is great! It&apos;s really nice to make all those sinful snacks without feeling too guilty.<br>It&apos;s super easy to clean after as well.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The time for cooking sometimes is a bit more than indicated.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">we received the philips viva airfryer as a gift and we thought it would add a healthy angle to our diet but did not expect taste to be the greatest. we tried the first time and we hardly use the fryer now! even the kids like the taste of chips, burgers and nuggets.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">highly recommended!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I can&apos;t believe how wonderfull normal oven chips come out of the Airfryer, crisp, not oily and fluffy inside. I haven&apos;t tried making from freshh potatoe yet as I had a stock of oven chips on stand by for the Airfryer arrival.<br>you will be amazed at how much oil drips off of the oven chips during cooking, this is what they used to lie in when being cooked in the oven!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Great item. Chips cooked &amp; taste lovely without the fat!!! Cooks everything to perfection</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This takes longer than stated in the instructions to get even slightly brown chips</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Absolutely great results - the best calamari strips by far than frying in oil. operation is simple but look earlier to check as some times were a little long. What a relief to have no smell of oil lingering for hours. As almost no oil involved draining is a dream.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I purchased the air fryer because my husband loves chips but had been advised to reduce his fat intake. He was about to switch reluctantly to boiled potatoes only, when Philips sent us details of the air fryer.<br>The chips are just fantastic - dry, crispy and delicious. The taste far exceeds anything from a conventional fryer. It is rare that a product of such quality and innovation arrives on the market - the fact that it has enormouse health gains is a great plus.<br>Two small points though - the inner basket sometimes falls out unexpectedly so an improved catch would be worth considering. Also the rubber feet stick so well to the surface that they sometimes get left behiond when the fryer is lifted.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It is easy to use chips tastes great<br>does more the potatoes chips<br>have cooked somosa and other vegetables.<br>Easy to clean<br>Safe to use has a timer, have no problem with youngsters using it ( no hot oil problem).</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Airfryer is alot bigger then the picture online, it takes alot of room up.<br>The divider is very loose ie does not fit.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have found this fryer, fantastic. Not only does it do chipsI have cooked sausage rolls. pie,s scampi. Fish .flan.s and much more. homemade and frozen. Living on my own. I have found this to be a great help in the kitchen as it just sits on the worktop. No more having to struggle bending down to the.big oven Also cost-effective. can not wait for the baking tin to come in stock, to try more Recipes</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">this is great. Cooks quick, easy, no fat, thought about it for some time because of the price wish I had bought it earlier worth every penny wouldnt be without it now</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Only used it to cook chips and roast potatoes yet but both were excellent.<br>Very low in fat, nice and crispy and very hot.<br>Best of all no oil to get rid of and extra easy to clean.<br>However it is larger than I expected.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Was very sceptical about this product at first but since I&apos;ve had it I haven&apos;t looked back.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I&apos;m very easily distracted and often burn things, however thanks to this Phillips timer, when it reaches zero, it turns itself off! Fantastic!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Although you can&apos;t cook big things like pizza, it&apos;s fantastic for healthy potato wedges, chicken, pie and if you get the baking accessory which I highly recommend, you can bake cakes or even lasagne!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Top product!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">When I saw an advert for this i thought it was very expensive for a fryer. An offer from Slimming World and the glowing recomendations decided I would try it. I have not used it a lot yet so these are first impressions. Its not good for frozen chips, they taste like oven chips, dry and boring. I tried homemade chips and they are fantastic, with a good potato they tast better than fried chips and without all the fat. I tried them with spring rolls frozen and unfrozen, they came out well, but you have to experiment with the timing a bit. I tried battered fish frozen, it was quite good but timing needs more experimenting. On the whole so far its an extremely good buy especially for us chip addicts who are a bit overweight. I personally didn&apos;t like frozen chips done in it, but home made are really nice.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Brilliant product for a lower fat option.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very quick and simple to use</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">great product</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Although a little pricey, this really is a great product and I&apos;m certainly getting my money&apos;s worth. Been on a diet since October and totally changed the way I cook. This is just a bonus and so easy to do the kids dinners too. It is quicker than using an oven as you don&apos;t need to wait for it to heat up. I&apos;m really impressed and would recommend it to anyone.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">What can I say! Excellent fryer, compact and easy to use so good I bought two.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I can honestly say I don&apos;t know how I lived without this product! It is fantastic! It does what it says on the box and with better results than I could ever have imagined and is so easy to use, well worth the money!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">First up please note that this product is rather big, so make sure you have some good space free to where you want to put it.<br>Installation was a breeze; make sure all stickers are taken off, take out the main compartment and basket and make sure they are washed and dried before putting them in, then plug the device in, easy.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">At first I had a hard time at not getting the main compartment out as it easily slots out by pulling the handle, but in fact to remove the basket within, you need to press the button in and at the right angle push the handle up, I also had a frustrating time putting the basket back in and even at one point jammed my thumb which did give me a lot of discomfort, so do be careful, however now I have done it a few times I am not having that problem any more, so if you end up struggling also, be patient and you will pick up the technique pretty fast.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Using the AirFryer is actually really easy, most things do not require oil, but some still do although a very small amount ie. wedges require half a teaspoon, I personally used sunflower oil. Some foods you may want to experiment with timings etc.. however I used the exact instructions to cook myself some potato wedges and it cooked them perfectly, they tasted great and seemed.... fresh and healthy, no grease on them at all.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My favourite thing about this AirFryer is that it has a timer that will cut off the heat when it reaches &apos;0&apos;, this is great as I&apos;m easily distracted and often burn my food. Please note that when cooking, if the AirFryer is being used from cold make sure you add 3 minutes to the timer to let it &quot;pre-heat&quot;.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">As for Cleaning, it&apos;s really easy, just pull the main compartment out then either put it in the dishwasher or a quick scrub will do, just make sure it&apos;s cooled down first as it can get extremely hot.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Overall I&apos;m really pleased with this product, it&apos;s easy to use, cooks really well and it&apos;s healthy &amp; cleaner. so top marks from me!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Having previously owned a Tefal actifryer, which was excellent, until it developed a fault, when fortunately, still under the year&apos;s guarantee, and was unusable (but we sent it back to &apos;Ideal World&apos;, and obtained a full refund of the purchase price); I was extremely wary of buying a machine which, essentially, was of a similiar nature.<br>Thankfully, we overcame any doubts, and purchased one direct from the Philips On-line shop.<br>It was an inspired purchased: it is &apos;top quality&apos; in performance, extremely easy to use, and the only minor drawback is its capacity, which is less than the Tefal acti-fryer; however as our family is now just myself, and wife, it is more than sufficient for the two of us, and has also coped with the occasional two additional guests.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Having now used this product for over a month I cannot find any fault with it at all.<br>The versitility of it only increases with use and increased knowledge of its abilities.<br>The first advantage of no/low oil usage (healthy cooking) is followed by many more:- variable temperature control; timer control; more than one item cookable at the same time; multi item/multi method cooking, not just frying; easy Cleaning.<br>As well as this a comprehensive and informative manual is included and there are excellent on-line resources.<br>Admittedly it is heavy but this is an indication of its &apos;build quality&apos;.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">If you want to make chips healthy , this is the way to go. If you want to eat healthy food at a fast and simple way, this is the way to go. I cook everything from vegetables to meatballs to chips in Airfryer and I can&apos;t brag enough about it. It is the best thing I have in my kitchen so I bought another one :)</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">We have used this product far more than we anticipated. The new product with the baking tray insert will be even more useful. We would love to know how to buy one for our version of the product!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Makes great chips with very little oil, therefore very easy to clean after use and no risk of getting burnt by hot oil splashes and no hot oil smells. It also makes great fluffy roast potatoes again with the same benifits as mentioned. Haven&apos;t cooked anything else in it yet but will try.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I do not usually buy kitchen &quot;gadgets&quot; but having worked hard to lose excess weight and wanting very much to maintain the new me the notion of virtually fat free chips was too good to ignore.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I ordered on-line and it arrived very quickly. The instructions were simple and the fryer was easy to use. I tried it the same evening and have not looked back. Chips, roast potatoes, roasted root vegetables all with the merest smear of oil and in some cases some pepper or other spice. Superb. I have also cooked frozen oven chips, potato waffles and croquettes (these cook best in the baking pan which I also bought). The frozen items cook better in the fryer than in the oven or under the grill.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The machine is well built, easy to operate and looks good in the corner of the kitchen counter.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I wash the basket/pan after each use and it comes clean with less effort than the baking tray I used for oven chips . It is also easier to time and frees up my grill/small oven for other foods.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">An excellent buy which rates alongside my microwave and slow cooker for usefulness. (I haven&apos;t checked electricity usage but I suspect that because it heats up so quickly and is timed so precisely it might well be more economic than using the oven.)</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was very sceptical about this product when I ordered it, but I have found it to be awesome in so many ways...cooks frozen chips brilliantly. Along with onion rings, breaded chicken, fish fingers... Bagles straight from the freezer can be warmed in 5 mins and taste like they have been freshly baked...still finding uses, but I&apos;m very happy with it!!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Having used the Tefal actifry for nearly four years it needed replacing and I stumbled over the Phillips Airfry. It was a fortune find as the product is more versatile and produces better results, Low fat cooking and convenince at the touch of a button. This product shows the advances in air flow technology within the kitchen and really offers a 21st centuary alternative to the deepfat fryer and is a great bonus to the creative cook.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">As a satisfied actifry user, when it finnally stop working, the obvious choice would be to buy another. So took a chance with the airfryer, and very glad I did. It is fanstastic, one main advantage over the actifry is its none rotation, so the food remains in one piece. As long as you shake the food halfway through cookin I have had perfect results. Only draw back is size, perfect for two of us, but a family may find it not large enough. It is very easy keep clean.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I am still experimenting but so far have enjoyed everything that I have cooked in the airfryer. It is fast, efficient and very easy to clean. The Design is great. Of course, the big advantage is that apart from speed everything is so much healthier. Can&apos;t imagine life without my airfryer now.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The Airfryer is very easy to use for cooking food that is cooked in an oven such as oven chips, chicken legs etc, as well as fresh potatoes. Cooking time is short and the time can be varied to ensure that the resulting food is cooked to your preference. A seperator allows two different items can be cooked at the same time. The bowl and the basket can be hand washed or washed in a dishwasher, however the main unit which is designed to be wiped with a damp cloth has several nooks and cranies which are virtually impossible to access.<br>During the cooking process it is necessary to take the basket out of the base in order to shake up the contents, and it would help if the basket had a micro switch to switch off the heater and blower while the basket is removed.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I am delighted with the Air Fryer. I was using a regular deep fat fryer for our once-a-week chips, but wanted a safer, and healthier, way to cook them. It does not disappoint!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Does exactly what it claims, it&apos;s fast and effective and very useful</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT IS SO easy to use AND IT GIVES YOU GREAT CHIPS</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Bought the airfryer to replace a conventional deep fat fryer. Was a little sceptical as it is such a new concept but thought we should give it a go. In fairness, we have only used the airfryer for chips, but it was bought for that purpose. It took two tries to get the chips exactly as we like them but now its easy peasy. Brilliant results from this airfryer - chips golden brown and crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy in the middle, with the bonus that the airfryer is easy to clean (unlike the deep fat fryer). Would definitely recommend the airfryer and in fact have already sung the praises of it to friends.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The Airfryer cooks the best chips ever! Well cooked hot and crispy. Even my brother who rarely cooks loves to use it. Quick and easy to use its the best appliance ever I have bought for cooking. Well done Philips. Whats next?</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">this product is extremely versatile and as an aid to reducing fat consumption - marvellous. every day trying different recipes which means our oven is rarely used.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">THIS IS THE BEST ITEM I HAVE PURCHASED. THE FROZEN CHIPS (ESPECIALLY THE FRENCH FRIES) ARE EXCELLENT. NO GREASE AND VERY CRISPY.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Being no dab hand in the kitchen, most meals i cook come from the microwave or in the form of &apos;just add boiling water.&apos; Getting this airfryer has rendered my once loved Microwave and kettle obsolete as I&apos;m now able to create so much from just one machine.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Due to being tall, it takes up less surface space than Philips rivals models. Lives up to &apos;sense &amp; simplicity&apos; as its a joy to use. Came with a handy recipe book which gives some great ideas to get you going. Cooks tasty meals quickly and is no fuss to clean.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">You&apos;ll not be disappointed, worth every penny. Get one...NOW!</span>\n</div> "

"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I bought Philips Airfryer on my sister-in-law&apos;s recommendation. She bought one to help with her weight loss programme as it needs no oils or fats only air, as the name suggests. The speed at which the food is cooked is also quite impressive. My sister-in-law&apos;s opinion of this product persuaded other members of the family to purchase this marvellous cooking appliance.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">No good for home made chips. They burn round the edges and are not cooked in the middle. You can do the same in your oven.</span>\n</div> "

"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have nothing but good to say about this product in every way.I always use home fry oven chips and no fat at all and I always have superb results. I use it to heat up pies and pasties which it does extremely well saving on electricity and not coming out soggy like they would in the microwave.<br>I have had another make of air fryer which was nowhere near as good and after a few months with it being so hard to clean I threw it out and got the PHILIPS which is the tops.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">lovely chips and jackets .great tasting low fat food cooker</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This product is really easy to use, I like the timer arrangement as you just turn it to the required duration and away it goes. The chips are great, it is useful to have the metal cooking pot as it becomes more flexible. Great for 1 or 2 people or to cook part of a meal. The draw (basket fits into) feet are not very good and dont last long.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Beat my expectations. Excellent for familys or living on alone. Can set it up and let it go and be done without any hassle or oil. Healthy!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This Airfryer is well built, easy to operate and looks good. An excellent purchase which rates alongside my microwave and it heats up so rapidly and is timed so precisely it might well be more cost-effective than using the oven.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Had this machine for over 7 months.<br>have cooked many items to perfection in double quick time.<br>also gives fat almost fat free results</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Ok before we start, I am blind and therefore have to use the computer with specialized software, I bought this machine online on Tuesday expecting it to take at least a couple of months for me to fully appreciate all that you can do with this life saving technology. I say &quot;life Saving&quot; because last October I had a massive Heart Attack and was given the &quot;Don&apos;t eat fried foods&quot; speach.<br>I&apos;ve kept to this as much as possible but hey I love CHIPS!<br>I went for a check up on Monday and this nurse was telling me about Airfryers so when we returned home I got my Carer to order one. They don&apos;t only cook chips but one can cook a whole variety of chips I&apos;ve used it for all sorts, &quot;Beef Stew&quot;, &quot;Full English Breakfasts&quot; etc.<br>Ease of use, it is so easy to use even a VIP (Visually Impaired Person) can use it<br>The reason I gave a 4 star rating on the Design was I suppose I was hoping that it could be made even easier to use &quot;Make it Speak&quot; please.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Thank You so much Philips<br>Bob</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very Smart Design and very easy to use with front pullout cooking container and detachable fry basket. Easy to clean as long after use. I like the bell and auto switch off on the timer but the ticking noise it makes is a bit too loud for me and could do with being a bit quieter. The Air blower (essential of course) could do with being a bit quieter as well, but I am used to this now. to turn off before timer is complete you need to turn the timer back against resistance , which intuitively doesn&apos;t seem right, and I would also prefer an auto switch off of the Air blower when the cooking drawer is removed. There may be a reaon why it doesn&apos;t (eg it allows the element to overheat) though.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Resulting Cooked food is very good. I have only used it for Chips and a few other oven bake or fried food. You can cook battered fish in it at the same time as the chips using the divider of the basket. Ideal for One!! The fryer came with a booklet for basic and more adventurous cooking, which I might get round to use eventually. Early results in cooking were a bit patchy, and inconsistent, but with a bit of tweaking to the suggested cooking methods I now have 100% success with it.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I bought it to have healthier chips etc with less fat and not to use lites of oil which then have to be discarded periodically. Both these objectives are fulfilled with the Air Fryer.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Overall I am pleased with the product Design, construction, with ease of use and cooking quality. A few niggles as outlined above but I am getting used to these now.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Recently purchased a Philips Airfryer and so far extremely pleased.<br>Easy to use, virtually no odours and easy to keep clean.<br>Have now purchased the baking tray and am beginning to &apos;experiment&apos; with other applications.<br>Wish Philips gave a few more ideas of use with the product. Booklet a bit basic.<br>Eating Air-Fried food with a cleaner conscience!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This product makes excellent chips ,lovely fish and chicken battered fillets etc.The food is so much healthier ,not dripping with oil and tastes lovely .The Airfryer looks smart and is so easy to clean.Iwould recommend it to anyone.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I recently purchased the airfryer and its amazing...no need to soak the chips for 30mins...i peel chip and wash my potatoes,dry them off and spray with frylight...cook on 160 for 15 mins then turn up to 200 to brown and crisp...delicious!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">i found using the airfryer great, put eveything in, no use of different saucepans and baking dishes, and just one unit to wash afterwards, very liitle smell,could have done with the basket being a bit bigger, but great for my needs</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">An excellent product, well designed and really fit for the job of doing chips. As it is really a small fan oven, it is also good for warming pasties,sausage rolls and breakfast croisants [yummie]. Not tried it yet with meat,or fish but can&apos;t see any reason why it shouldn&apos;t do as well as a large fan oven except for quantity.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">A great looking product that also performs fantastically well. Takes a bit of time getting used to how long to cook different items, but once mastered, the results are excellent</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">A fantastic product that does exactly what it says. We use it to make chips from scratch but we&apos;ve also done all the roast veg for Sunday lunch and it was great. I&apos;m thinking of treating my mum she lives alone and this will save her money over the cost of running her oven.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was worried that once I bought this product it would become a kitchen gadget that took up space and was never used. I have however used the product at least once a week. I&apos;ve only used for chips so far but will experiment and try on other foods. Great product.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">love the Design and the fact that it is dishwasher friendly.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have had this product for a few weeks now and it replaced<br>my old deep fryer. This product is much more simple to use and<br>produces much better results food wise than my old product<br>and it doe&apos;s not take long to cook any type of food and the end result is less fatty food which must be good .</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was a little apprehensive about buying the airfryer as I didn&apos;t want a gadget sat in the back of the cupboard, how wrong can you be, it&apos;s great and I use it almost daily, no strong smells to fill the kitchen, cooks meat beautifully keeping it moist and full of flavour, as for chips my children love them! Roasties are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. It&apos;s very easy to clean, my only small criticism is that it would be better if the mesh base was detachable to clean.<br>Overall this is a great product, I am very happy with mine.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Great product. I have roasted a small roast with potatoes, browned part baked bread to perfection , made filo pastry desserts, and. Cooked fish with no kitchen smell. I purchased also the baking dish which is a must if you wish to cook cakes or if you want to cook something from a marinade. Frozen chips came out perfect<br>The cooking time is cut in half from conventional ovens and no need to turn on your oven at all in fact !!!<br>I recommend this product without hesitation so go and get one you will not regret it</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I found this product to be very easy to use, but it is hard to clean<br>behind the upper element. also i have reduced your recommended<br>cooking time to 25mins at 150c</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Vanishes all the problems and issues associted with a deep fat fryer. Cooks nice tasty chips and nice chicken to go with them.<br>No next day smell with this machine.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Wow - this has not only changed my cooking but has changed my way of life. To be able to eat the food I love but cut out the fat is absolutely marvellous.<br>The airfryer couldn&apos;t be simpler to use, the food cooks quicker than a conventional oven and the food tastes better. I use it very, very often; warming bread and pies, baking ham, roasting vegetables and making healthy chips. The chips are divine, my grandchildren say that they are the best they have ever tasted, I agree.<br>I was concerned about the initial outlay and whether it was justified, but I needn&apos;t have worried. It is by far the best and most useful, efficient and versatile kitchen appliance I have owned.<br>Well done Philips.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">A really marvelous product does what is says on the tin, chips great, roast potatoes good, heating pasties and sausage rolls magnificent, it is, in all respects a minny fan oven so whatever you do in your oven can be done in this, albeit in smaller quantities.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Easy to use,no mess,no fat and the chips are far better than oven ones. In fact if you allow the chips slighty more time to cook than is recommened then they are virtually the same as those cooked in oil.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Since receiving my Philips Air fryer, not a day has gone by without me using it. I love baked potatoes , but the Air fryer doesn&apos;t do them, however by cooking the potatoes first in my microwave, then putting the cooked potato in the Air fryer for 15 minutes at 200 c, the result is a perfect crispy baked potato, from start to finish in around 27 minutes.<br>I&apos;ve cooked other food, some not shown in the cookbook, all have come out absolutely perfect, every time.<br>This Airfryer is one of Philips best ever products, perfect in every way</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">After several experiments based on the instructions provided it&apos;s easy to learn what&apos;s required time, temperature and shaking wise.<br>I enjoy the chips.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Great results best option for low fat diets and easy to use</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">since getting the airfryer have used it nearly every day i love the chips and have done baked potatoes in it takes around 27 mins but the potato has been so light and fluffy with the skin a little bit crispy with the oil i spray on top of it would recommend to all my friends to get one best buy ever</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I had this for christmas, used it for the first time to make chips last night and they were much nicer than doing them in the oven and not greasy. If i fancy chips i will be cooking my own now instead of heading to the chippy :) I&apos;m looking forward to experimenting with some seasonings and making some homemade fish fingers and crumbed camembert. Definately does not smell at all.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My actifry broke and I replaced it with the Airfryer. Don&apos;t know if I am doing anything wrong but my chips are not turning out tasty at all. At the moment I am disappointed, but I read loads of reviews before buying it and they were all complimentary, which made me decide to buy the Airfryer. I shall keep trying and hopefully I will get it right and be singing its praises along with everyone else.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I saw this on a shopping channel and when I saw it on sale in a local shop I had to buy it. I haven&apos;t used my oven since I bought it. It reheats sausage rolls in about 4 minutes, makes the best potato wedges ever, you need to use olive oil though, low fat spray doesn&apos;t do a proper job. Everything I have cooked has been so moist in the middle as it doesn&apos;t dry food out. Cooks sausages to perfection and brown all the way around. Oven chips come out crisp and fluffy. I am so pleased I bought this, only regret is I should have bought one ages ago.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I absolutely love this product, it has literally replaced my oven.<br>Regard it as a desktop, small fan oven, which only takes 3 minutes to warm up, and cooks anything I want for dinner in 10-20 mins.<br>Suitable for 1-2 people max.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Biggest problem is that it absolutely stinks out my whole flat if I use more than 1 teaspoon of oil to coat potato chunks or chips. You literally need almost no oil whatsoever.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The construction is VERY high Quality, it is extremely sturdy, metal construction &amp; feels like it will last many years. They just need to re-engineer it so that it includes an odour filter at the back, as spewing out hot, oily air from the back, is not a good thing.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It cooks chips to perfection, fish is fantastic too. Haven&apos;t tried many other things in but I will. Love it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Use this every week love the roast pots and chips,also done chicken and mushrooms now I&apos;m more use to it I am going to start trying other things</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Excellent .. No smell</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Cooks in no time at all</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">fantastic product !!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Rather large and needs to sit on the work top.however only cooks up to 800 gr. lovely for one or two. Have cooked chips perfectly both homemade and frozen alongside chicken turkey scampi and spring roles Planning to experiment with other foods. For me a great gadget with even less oil used than stated in book. Cooked on the highest temperature and time stared to get result I wanted.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">this product is so simple to use and there is no need to wiat for it to warm up its seems to be hot instantly. It is very nice looking and has nice simple buttons to make it easy to use. It is easy to clean both inside and out and is also able to be cleaned in the dishwasher although I have only cleaned it by hand as it didn&apos;t seem to get dirty enough to need to be cleaned in the dishwasher.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Brilliant innovation. It changes our life style and cooking method. It is extremely easy to use. Already recommended to many friends.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Amazed at how little oil is required. I have made my own chips and they were very nice, not greasy at all. Oven chips are easy to use and take slightly less time to cook = but very tasty. I bought the cake pan as an extra but haven&apos;t used it yet. I would have liked to see more cake and bun Recipes in the recipe book. On the whole, a very good buy, would recommend to everyone.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Wasn&apos;t convinced until I cooked my first batch of chips, now I love it</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Well this is a great product, easy to use, clean and efficient. We&apos;ve only done chips so far but they were delicious and then we went on a diet to shed those christmas and new years pounds we had put on so it went into the cupboard to re-emerge when we have reached our target weight.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Have used it a lot already, but perhaps more as a mini fan oven than specifically a low fat fryer. I&apos;m working my way through my recipe books and anything that I would normally make in my big oven I&apos;m giving a go in the Airfryer, and so far it hasn&apos;t let me down. It&apos;s particularly great for doing meals for one, where putting on the main oven would seem like a great extravagence</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Brilliant. Great tasting food easily made.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I know I&apos;ve giving it full marks but I promise I don&apos;t work for the company.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have used this machine for potatoes, other vegetables and for chicken. Chicken pieces cooked well, not so happy with chicken on the bone. Vegetables excellent.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Would like a fitted dish inside the basket so that I can try baking eg brownies.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Easy to keep clean.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Had an Actifry before this, never again.<br>The Philips airfry beats it hands down.<br>Tastier,crispier,more stylish.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">once you adjust the temperature to the way you like your chips cooked this product is great - very easy to use and clean - no worries over Safety - a healthy choice - and eventually cost efficient as you don&apos;t have to buy bucket loads of oil - would need the larger model for a family meal</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">We have had our Philips Air Fryer for about a month now, and have cooked a number of things in it ... All with excellent results using no more than a couple of teaspoons of oil.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Frozen or fresh, the results have been very good ... Baked items like samosas or bhajis were hot and crisp, fish works very well, and even left over new potatoes can be perked up with a little spice.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Our favourite though is spiced sweet potato chips ... Ready in about 20 minutes ... Delicious and healthy.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very easy to clean, a quick soak, wipe out and dishwasher will do the trick.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This is the perfect size for up to four people for chips ... Portion sizes might seem a little mean if you try and cook for more.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">OK, It&apos;s not for sausages and burgers (it doesnt cook high level fat foods, the book tells you that) but it is fantastic! The chips are fantastic, gonna try roasties tomorrow. You need to experiment at first with what temperature and how long (there is a book to guide you) but tweek the times to obtain perfection (crispy fries!... Chips that dont sag!). I would recommend this product and it is good Value for money in my opinion.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It makes great chips. And everything else too.It is also very easy to clean.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It was recommended to me fantastic product cook&apos;s with hot air no fat glad I bought it. fat free chips.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I love the Airfryer . Still got a bit to learn and try out other things to cook in it. I heated some little pasties form M&amp; S the other day , which wouldn&apos;t have been worth putting the oven on for. If they had been put in the Microwave they would have been soggy. Battered Onion Rings are good . Favorite things are Baked potatoes although I do tend to start them off in the microwave for a few minutes as they took too long to cook them completely in the Air fryer. We also prefer chips done in the Airfryer than a conventional oven.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Although a little larger than expected the Philips Airfryer is excellent.<br>It is so much easier than using an oven and with a little adjustment to the recommended temperatures and times, chips and chops can be cooked together. What little oil that is left in the bottom is easily cleaned. Worth every penny!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Very quick delivery , plenty of packaging . no need to buy oil .Easy Cleaning . Have cooked chips which were the best we have had for a long while . We have tried roast veg which were very nice .Easy store cord for tidiness. Vey light weight .Would recommend to anyone .</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Great product , easy to use, no mess, great result.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Only had this for a short time but it cooks lovely chips from the bag with no extra oil. It is very stable on the worktop and is very.clean after use.<br>Still waiting to try other items eg chicken pieces etc but probably one of the best appliances we have bought recently.<br>Great to release the pan by a single button, but you just have to make sure that the basket is over a work surface when you press the button, otherwise pan will fall to the floor. But we have got used to that now !!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Treated myself to Airfryer and glad I did it cuts out a lot of time cooking in conventional way. Chicken is cooked crisp and tender great for warming snacks and very healthy cant wait to get baking pan accessory for it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Having bought Philips products since the 1960`s I have always been pleased with the products I have bought.<br>The Airfryer was as good as described,it did everything I wanted from it and cooked the most perfect chips you could ever taste.<br>Having been fed up with oven chips for years it made the chips so light and with no taste of fat,this is a sure winner from Philips.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Have had this product for some months now and use it most days. So easy to use and clean. Chips are great (I cut the chips chunky and boil them in water for five minutes, drain, then put them in a bowl with 1/2 teasp. oil, then cook them in the Airfryer for 15 to 20 minutes at 200 until golden and crisp), even my husband thinks they are great. Have been waiting for ages for the baking tin to be available, but unfortunately it is still out of stock.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I absolutely love the AirFryer. I have used it every day since I bought it and am still finding things to cook in it. I tried a small basic pizza yesterday, adding extra tomato slices grated cheese and chorizo, it cooked beautifully, top nice and melted and base just right. I have cooked pre- baked sausage rolls, which come up brown, hot and crispy, chops, chicken breasts and fish are quick and easy. I haven&apos;t tried baking in it yet but intend to try soon. The baking tin is much too expensive - a third of the cost of the fryer. I measured the Basket size and bought one from another shop for &#xFFFD;4. It hasn&apos;t got a handle but apart from that does the job perfectly. If you want to see demos of food being cooked in the Airfryer go to YouTube, there are lots of ideas. I could go on and on, but better still try it yourselves, I highly recommend this appliance</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I had been considering an &quot;air fryer&quot; for some time now, as my hairdresser got one and swears by it. After much deliberation and investigation, I opted for the Philips Airfryer, rather than the market competitor.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">So far, I have cooked frozen oven chips and fish fingers in it. I&apos;ve also made home made roast potatoes and chips. I can honestly say that the roasters were brilliant! In fact, my husband keeps asking for roast potatoes for dinner. The chips I think could do with being a bit thicker, but will try them again.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Only downside with the fish fingers was that the breadcrumbs stuck to the basket, but this also happens when I cook them in the oven.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I haven&apos;t ventured to cook anything from the cookbook yet, but I certainly will. I also found some You Tube videos from Philips on how to cook Chips, Baked Potatoes and Sausages! Well done Philips, you have certainly won my vote on this product.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This product is well designed and easy to use. So far we have only made chips, chicken and ratatouille (from recipe book provided), with great results. The food was tastier and cooked far better than our conventional gas oven ever could. The quick reference card is a brilliant addition. The only reason why I have not given full marks for overall rating is because the separator and baking dish was not supplied with this model and I have had to purchase these separately.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">easy to use easy to clean and GREAT CHIPS<br>NOt too big for the smaller kitchen. Need to learn some things to cook from the recipe book now.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I bought the air fryer with an open mind but I couldn&apos;t believe the taste and crispiness of the chips I haven&apos;t used it for anything else yet but I think it will be fantastic, the grandchildren love the chips from it so anyone with children should own one and give their kids a healthy treat.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It is so good to have a machine that can cook chips and other foodstuffs without using lots of oil, it will help to keep the diet healthy and there is lots of potential for cooking all kinds of dishes, I am looking forward to trying out more recipes. It is so easy to use and to clean and the design makes it a good size that does not take up too much space on the kitchen work surface.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">this airfryer is easy to use and extremely healthy. would recommend for everyone to buy. little bit pricey but same price as similar products.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">i have had the airfryer about a month and love it you can cook just about anything in it and has cut down how much i use my oven by loads, before i had the airfryer i had a actifry for about 3 yrs and i would say i can do a lot more in the airfryer than the actifry</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">What can I say. Been looking at these for a while but bought at half price. Love it. Chips are great. Cooks brilliant. Nobody in our house has complained yet. Crunchy outside. Fluffy inside. Will be trying other food shortly.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Solid build quality, cooks very well, can be treated as a small conventional cooker, ideal for two people.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The only drawback would be it could be a bit bigger and you have to buy the pan to go inside separately which is expensive. Overall makes great potato and polenta chips.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Nothing bad to say about this fryer - great taste and extremely convenient to use.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The only small downside is that it is quite hard to clean!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This is an excellent fryer that cooks very quickly and make the food taste very nice. Even if you uae cheaper products, they still taste nice but the design and size of tje fryer is good as it does not take so much space on the kitchen work top. We even take it to my parents house sometimes. Never used the traditional fryer again.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Excellent product. Very easy to use and chips etc are very good. The only improvement that could be made is in the amount of washing up that is needed everytime the appliance is used.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">its very good, and ofcourse healthy way of cooking, but bit noisy and lid should be transparent to check the browning of food to not overcolor.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">A smashing cooker,very easy to use &amp; makes food taste a lot better as its not covered in any oil.Very glad ive bought one.I wish they had been around a lot sooner.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Have only used the Airfryer thus far for fried potatoes but was pleased with the result. Far less hassle than using a deep fat fryer &amp; obviously a healthier option.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Compact Design fits easily under wall cupboards. easy to use, fries chips beautifully, does not break them up like other product I have used. Also does great toasted sandwiches, better than sandwich maker. I used frozen bread which toasted well and was beautifully light and crispy. Have not had time to try all the Recipes but I am happy with the results already. Would highly recommend.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have discarded the chip pan for a healthier option</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">We have only had this a couple of weeks and can honestly say it does exactly what it says on the box. Brilliant, crispy food in very short times, highly efficient, perfect for the two of us for low fat chips and just about anything else that you can fry.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">So far we have done perfect, home made, chunky fries, fish fingers, chicken thighs, roast potatoes, mini jacket potatoes, wedges and best of all, steak, chips and grilled tomato all at once!!!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It&apos;s fun just experimenting and easy to clean.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Highly recommended</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">One warning though if warming papadoms place a heat resistant weight on the top papadom to stop them taking off into the grill!!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This product is a wonderful idea and a better way to cook. It is much cleaner and a healthier way of eating. I would recommend it to anyone and would advise that is a fabulous new way to prepare food for eating.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This was a replacement fryer. I have used this one more than the last one as it does not stir the food it does not break up in the fryer. I have used this for indian and Chinese starters, Cornish pasties, fishfingers, wedges and lovely home made crispy chips. I tend to do all the things I used to do in the oven in half the time with this. It does not take up much room either. All round good multi-purpose fryer. Very happy customer</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have had this product 2 days and it&apos;s changed the way I cook! As a busy mum to two young boys I couldn&apos;t imagine tea time being any easier, it is!!!!<br>I love this product, the food tastes amazing without the oil.<br>I can honestly say I would never own a chip pan again, great for chips, onion rings, chicken bit, nuggets, fish fingers, jacket potatoes and just about any children&apos;s food</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">EXCELLENT</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Will never buy oven chips again. Perfect for us as we can have chips without syn on slimming world.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The brochure lists a food separator so that you can cook more than one item, but after searching frantically for it, I&apos;m told by customer service that it&apos;s only included in some countries. It&apos;s ridiculous that such a simple, cheap and essential part is not included when all the documentation says that it is.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Every student should have one of these.<br>This product would be outstanding if the lower tray was teflon coated to make cleaning easier</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Found the air fryer simple and easy to use, enjoy trying out new things to cook using it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was very impressed food tastes great not dry cooks chicken wonderfully,have recommended to all .Have not tried cakes yet but am eager to try .Is so easy to clean can even go in a dishwasher very happy owner!!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">We have had this air fryer now for almost 2 years and we use it around 4 times a week and not just for chips. It&apos;s amazing for chicken thighs with a dry rub or chicken wings, small cakes etc. This is proper good design and you can bung it into a dishwasher. Together with the Home Cooker we have totally changed cooking for the better.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Philips: What would be a wicked as an attachment to this fryer is a popcorn basket. IMAGINE</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">We have thrown out the micro.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Absolute rubbish, perhaps Philips would like to send someone round to my place and prove me wrong!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Glad I purchased this fryer so quick and easy to use and the food tastes great.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My Mam bought me this for christmas, (she too as one!)<br>No matter what you cook these it tastes great!<br>Never greasy or dry!<br>I&apos;ve hardly used my oven since!<br>Easy to use &amp; little to fault.<br>My only slight niggle is the mesh basket is hard to keep spotless.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Every time we cook it&apos;s an experiment, now down to just two small teaspoons of fat for chips, also found the bigger the chip size the better the outcome. The recipe book does not cover some staples e.g steak 10 mins, as easy as duck breast and pork steaks, same timings, perfectly cooked. Also we use it for sausages, pierced to let fat flow out of them, they taste just as good. These ideas came from the Internet.<br>Best yet was scotch eggs, with the same as any other recipe: boiled egg, sausage meat then breadcrumbs. The crust is created with a very little fat added to the mixture which is then pressed onto the sausage meat and rolled to reduce crumbs. We keep reducing fat on all the Recipes, although the books say 1 tablespoon max.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have always been happy with the products of Philips, but in my opinion Airfryer is a bad product ever created by Philips! You never cooked chips which look like in McD, KFC etc. It&apos;s impossible. Meat cooked in the Airfryer always dry. Only some vegetables (like tomatoes) are obtained succulent.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I purchased this Phillips Airfryer hoping to be able to eat some of my favorite foods without having to fry them. I love fried chicken and French fries. I have discovered that I can have it all. Both the chicken and French fries are done to perfection. And even though the instructions say that I can add a few tablespoons of oil, it&apos;s really not necessary, especially for the chicken. I just add whatever spices I like and the airfryer does the rest.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My family really likes this product. When I bought it, I had some aggressive ideas in mind regarding Recipes and it is workings like a charm. No hot oil mess or handling, awesome and healthier.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It cooks fried pork meat (carne frita), ribs, smashed plantains (tostones), blood sausages (morcillas), Argentinian turn overs (empanadillas argentinas), egg rolls and many more. We are still discovering more uses.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Highly recommended.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Best product I have bought in a long time, get one or miss out</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have had my fryer for about two months and have made wings, fries (fresh and frozen), cheese sticks, etc. and everything has come out tasting delicious. I would like an additional basket so that I could swap them and cook continuously. Hopefully this will be offered in the future.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE THIS AIR FRYER ! I&apos;VE COOKED SHRIMP, FILET MIGNON WRAPED IN BACON.FRESH POTATOES ,MADED PERFECT FRYS, CHICKEN COATED WITH PANCO CAME OUT CRISPY,EGGPLANT COATED WITH PANCO ITALIAN BREAD CRUMBS. THIS IS A WINNER. I LOVE IT . I COOK ALMOST EVERY DAY WITH IT. THE CLEAN UP IS VERY EASY.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">French fries turned out fantastic. Used it to cook frozen hamburger patties and they came out perfectly browned, and moist. Best of all no splatters to clean up. I use it every other day for my steamed fish and I love it, fish comes out tender and moist with just enough browned color to make it eye appealing.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This was a win win deal for me.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I purchased this air fryer because I was trying to eliminate all the oil that is used in cooking and all that goes with it-lugging big bottles of oil and than having to dispose of it as well. Well, I saw this advertised on hsn and decided to try it. It was the best decision I could have made! It not only saves on oil but time and very little heat in the kitchen-no big oven to heat up because it not only fries with air but bakes as well. It has a fairly large capacity and being that it is done by hot air swirling around, it also quick and convenient. It has many Recipes to try and will take care of the quick and easy ones too. Try it-you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">was always making fries with an oil fryer, 1st you have to preheat for 10 min then you put fries in another 10 min the fries are done, with this 15 min and fries are done perfectly. oh yes and with the oil fryer Cleaning it is impossible,with this easy clean up</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Found it very nicely designed and the Basket size very large. Tried many items and seemed to be hit or miss as to whether the item I tried to cook was crisp or soggy. The timer sometimes would not stop on the appropriate number setting and there is no way to clear it once it is set. Was not too happy that the basket did not have a lock so it could be opened anytime to check. Might have liked it with more Recipes. Could not find additional Recipes online either.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have had this Low fat fryer for a month now, After giving up frayed foods for at least three years. Very easy to use, no mess clean up, foods come out perfectly fried!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Just stopped by the Philips site to see if I could find more Recipes.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was overwhelmed when I took it out of the box. It takes getting used to and some trail and error. They do not have Recipes on their website as stated in the presentation. Very disappointing. I am sure as I get more confidant I will love it. It is big but it fit under my counter. They need to provide more information in the form of Recipes and tips that we can go by as we get used to it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The air fryer is great. I think it is the best advance in cooking since sliced bread!! Even my nickpicky sister loves using it and the clean up is a breeze!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Love it !!<br>Will buy for Christmas for my mom and sisters</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I like how the fryer cooks, however, the recipe book that came with it is VERY small and limited so using the fryer is more trial and error than &quot;easy as pie&quot;. The advertisement leads you to believe NO oil is necessary to &quot;fry&quot;, that also is not true, however, the amount of oil you use is minimal. For the steep price I expected more detailed user information. I found out foods tend to stick to the basket so I now use a product like Pam to keep this to a minimum. The things that cook best in this fryer are things meant to be cooked in an oven (i.e., prepackaged). Using fresh produce, meat, etc. things turn out but only after a lot of work and trying to figure out the correct time/temperature. I would recommend it on the merit that it does reduce the amount of oil in fried foods and as I use it more and more I will, most likely, learn to like it more. Right now I give it a 6 out of 10.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This does what it says it will do. And does it VERY well. I&apos;ve made both homemade and frozen fries - both were excellent. Finally went for it and did fried chicken: boneless, skinless thighs, no less. The family RAVED!!! It&apos;s so wonderful to have fried foods again - and less fat than if we grilled them!!<br>I would have given it 5 stars across the board except for one rather glaring oversight in the Design. The non-digital control - perhaps not so much the timer, though that is bad enough - but the temperature control. It&apos;s just not user-friendly. It&apos;s hard to tell what temperature you are cooking with.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Last night I made chicken wings in our new airfryer and WOW, the chicken was cooked to perfection in under 20 minutes and the meat was tender and juicy without the added fat from a deep fryer. We have tried fries and other frozen items but I am so impressed with the result of fresh chicken.<br>This is a definate addition to my countertop that will be used frequently.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It opens up an entirely new way to cook and prepare healthier foods!! It cooks fast, cooks great and great tasting food comes out of this gem!!<br>My sister got one before me, she loves it, convinced me to get it, and we bake and bake and bake. Now I just ordered some of the Accessories [which I have been waiting for] and I cannot wait to start using them.<br>buy this, use this, love this!!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This product has exceeded my expectations in every way. My kids and I love using this for quickly making tots, fries, chicken nuggets, wings and patties, and other typically frozen foods that are better when deep fried. I have recently tried fresh chicken, which turned out great, using the Jerk recipe from the book. I just ordered Accessories for the AirFryer and am looking forward to expanding the use of this awesome product.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Got this product a few weeks ago. Great item for oil less frying. More time needed to use fresh potatoes.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I wish though the basket inside is easier to clean. Even though I spray spam inside the basket, it is still hard to get rid of the grease and stuff.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">It might be little bit better if the inside is bigger so it can at least makes 4 servings instead of only 2 servings each time. Not very practical for family of 4!</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">But other than that, this product is great. I love it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I received my air fryer about a week ago and have used it practically every day. It is so easy to use, cleans up beautifully, and cooks like a dream. I live alone so the small basket is perfect for me. If you have a larger family, don&apos;t let this deter you from purchase. You will just have to so a few extra batches, but it is well worth the extra effort.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I&apos;ve been using this daily for about a month after using the Nuwave oven, and this just blew me away. Every dish I tried, turned out better than expected SPECIALLY the Tandoori chicken legs I cooked over the weekend. The grill attachment was perfect for the chicken Can&apos;t believe how EASY it is to clean. Just love it and hope the fryer lasts for a while :^)</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">The Air Fryer is the greatest, I use it all the time I have purchased the baking pan and also the grill pan and they also are great. Waiting for the double rack to be available I will have that too. I really love this product.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I was very disappointed to read in the instruction manual that I should use frozen, pre-prepared fries in the AirFryer. This is certainly not what I expected.<br>I followed the instructions for home-made fries and they were OK.<br>I have not tried cooking anything else yet, so I can&apos;t really recommend it. I was surprised how big it is - it takes up a lot of space and I don&apos;t have a convenient place to keep it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Used my Air Fryer for the first time today. I made chicken wings and it was soooo easy. Glad I bought this product and I am sure I will be doing so much more with it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This Multicooker is great for doing those frozen snacks that take twice as long in a conventional oven or come out soggy in a microwave. Then there&apos;s the lack of having to use oil for making dishes from scratch. Chicken wings come out as crisp as being fried in a deep fryer! Buffalo Wings without the mess and odors of a quart of oil bubbling on the counter. It&apos;s great, when was the last time you had a perfect grilled cheese sandwich in 4 min?</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Bought this after reading some Amazon reviews. Have only used it to make French fries and they are great. No oil is used at all. I know there will be other products I will use it for, but so far it has been effortless.<br>I wonder how this compares with a convection oven.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">A great product but woefully lacking in good Recipes to use. You have to just try things out yourself to determine times and temperatures. There are just so many more things that can be cooked in this airfryer than you show in your little recipe book. But, putting that aside, I find myself using it more and more and doing a lot of experimenting on my own. It is a fabulous cooking device.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I&apos;m cutting to the chase...if you love fried food but want to live a healthy lifestyle this is a MUST HAVE!!! Bought this after watching it on HSN. I thought it was too good to be true, but I&apos;m here to tell you it truly is fabulous. You name it, I&apos;ve tried it. From chicken wings to fried cauliflower and everything you could imagine in between, this is hands down the easiest, most impressive kitchen appliance I own. I leave it on the counter, since we use it so much, and everyone that comes over asks me what it is. When I tell them, they don&apos;t believe it, so I let the Airfryer speak for itself. People are floored! Five Stars!!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This is a must have in your home. I was in total shock when I airfryed potatoes without any oil at all and they turned out brown, and crunchy!! I made grill cheese sandwiches, even took out some homemade cheese raviolis and made them as appetizers. This airfryer is so wonderful that I am telling all my friends and family to buy one, because you really and truly can eat your foods without the oil. I won&apos;t miss the calories or the expense of oil again! Great product, you will be sorry if youj don&apos;t buy one!!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Love this item I do everything in it that requires oil . I have mastered pies which is a southern favorite. Yesterday grilled fish with it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">This is the best appliance ever. It crisps, fries and wings perfectly. I added little more timing bad didn&apos;t over crowd the wings at 390. Awesome. No more greasy food and easy clean ups. Buying the baking unit now</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">My wife made French fries with both regular potatoes and pre-cut potatoes from the store. Both turned out golden and tasty, but the latter were crispier on the outside. She also &quot;fried&quot; &quot;kibbeh&quot; (about 15 fit in the basket). They turned out just like regular-fried ones, without all the oily smell around the house. Delicious too!<br>So far, so good! We did not buy the Accessories, and frankly think that the Basket size is just right. Look around for a lower price. We recommend it!</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I saw the demo of this on HSN and was amazed so I bought it. I&apos;m glad I did. This product is awesome. It crisps bacon at 390 degrees in less than ten minutes. Grilled cheese, 5 minutes. Just brush the bread with a tiny bit of olive oil or butter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes fried food but does not like the oil that goes with it.</span>\n</div> "
"\n<div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I have fried fresh chicken wings, fresh shrimp, fresh french fries and frozen fries along with a host of other frozen appetizers. This machine is amazing. No old oil to dispose of and a breeze to clean (just put it in the dishwasher). Fantastic!</span>\n</div> "
"Have just used my new air fyrer and was so surprised with my delicious crispy chips they are fabulous.  Just wondering now who I can buy one for a christmas present."
"What a wonderful fryer it made my chips taste great and no oil i have even  made a chocolate cake cant wait to see what other goodies i can make once again thank you amazon for making it so easy to buy from your site and your good service etc you really are a good company"
"I was very excited about purchasing the Airfryer having been impressed by the product description and the good reviews. Perhaps my expectations were too high.<br><br>Firstly, the product is poorly designed. It comes in a huge box which is heavy (as the product description states). The product itself is ungainly. It took two of us to get it out of the box! The packaging is designed in a way that means you can't remove it until it is out of the box. It would be much easier to unpack if you could lift off the top half of the packaging and remove the cooker.<br><br>The Airfryer is very big and has no handles, simply indents at the base of the unit, making it easy to tip over when you lift it up or and difficult to move it around. It is not suitable for a compact London kitchen. The mechanism that separates the frying basket from the oil tray is at the top of the handle, exactly where you naturally put your thumb. My partner barely escaped being scalded by hot oil when removing the cooking compartment to get his chips out (like most men, he didn't read the instruction manual).<br><br>Critically, I found the fryer was very disappointing in it's performance. The chips we got out of it were neither crisp nor golden, just brown in patches and almost raw in others. We followed the instructions exactly and the results were nothing like the photos shown. We also tried rosti recipe, which requries additional equipment (not made clear until the end of the recipe). This was vaguely crisp around the edge and soggy in the centre and bottom of the pan.<br><br>I would suggest that anyone who is looking to buy this also purchase some patience and be prepared for a lot of trial and error. It might be an acceptable product for those who are watching their weight (or like their chips soggy), but I will be returning to my frying pan and oven which have always given me much better results."
"I was delighted to find something new that received some good reports and didn't take 20 to 30 mins to cook frozen chips (as the Tefal Actifry does). I bought it shortly after it's launch (then 200 pounds on Amazon .... now about 25 pounds less) and tried it on home made chips - not great ... but, hey ... why should I care? As up to now I've always used frozen chips in a deep fryer. The deep fryer gave fab results - but also an unhealthy amount of fat.<br>So the AirFryer is a much healthier option and takes an acceptable 15 mins (a little longer than the instructions suggest) for delicious results.<br><br>However I don't find it as versatile as a deep fryer as it does not cook some of the foods you could deep fry - but it also means you eat a healthier diet.<br><br>Large and Heavy - yes, as some reviews say the machine is quite large (the actual counter top 'foot-print' is about the same as a deep fryer but it is twice as tall). However height is not a problem in my kitchen. Yes it is fairly heavy - but as there is no oil inside you don't need to worry about tipping it as you move it to store it. And not as heavy as an old-fashioned cake Mixer & bowl device.<br><br>So - on balance a good addition if you like to have chips or similar from time to time and want to a healthier diet AND great if you HATE cleaning deep fat fryers (all that encrusted brown 'fat' that adhered to the lid and bowl etc.)"
"Luckily this came with a \"60 day satisfaction warranty\".Whether it was just me --I don't know but Itried it for aweek and followed instructions,and nothing came out nice.Sloppy chips,Pale chicken,etc etc.Bought it cos I.d had 3 tefal airfryers ,which cooked perfectly,but they all broke(in the warranty period),so shall be getting another one of those,if they fix the weaknesses...."
"Bought this to replace our Tefal actifry which went bang, seemed expensive but decided with the 2 year warranty to try it. It still takes as long as the actifry if you want chips with a bit of colour and with an open basket instead of a solid bottom of the actifry theres not so much choice of what you can put in also you have to stir them round to get even cooked.  Of course now the price is also a third off in the sales which will come down as it gets older like anything else and Tefal have changed their Design so theres for and against for each really."
"The worst gift I could have got, the item is huge and is just too heavy. we cooked Samosas in it and the hassle to cook the oil first then putting in the samosas and then half way having to take the basket out and shake off all the oil and putting it back . It would be the same as frying it on the stove as you have to watch it cook. I was expecting to be able to leave it to cook and carry on with other things but that was not what I got. On top of all the work that had to be done to cook it they were not cooked proper and got burnt on the sides and not cooked too well in the middle. parts of the basket had samosas bits stuck on it. The only good thing I can say about the machine is that there is a money back guarantee as I have sent this item back, for a refund, as it is not worth the money I paid."
"I got the AirFryer for chiefly cooking low fat chips, I was diappointed with the end result chips came out soggy, brown not tasting like chip shop chips as advertised."
"Quite useless and I am sure that the manufacturer knows this as they have set up a marketing logistics company to handle a no quibbles return of the product within 60 days. I purchased this product primarly to cook chips. Philips advise that cooking of this item requires the addition of oil, half a tablespoonful. I prepared the chips and then added the oil thoroughly shaking the basket to ensure an as even as possible coating. I then set the timer and temperature as per the instructions. The instructions state that at the halfway point that the basket be removed and shaken. On removal of the basket I found the contents to be burned to a dark brown leathery texture on the tops and raw on the bottom. Needless to say, the Airfryer is now winging its' way back to the marketing logistics company."
"I bought this product as a Christmas present for my self (Widowed,over 70, don't cook in the accepted sense) purely on the great reports on this forum. I can't stop enthusing about it, it simply makes cooking so simple and quick, clean, cheap (on fuel costs) and fat free. I don't bother with the book that came with it, I just keep trying anything and everything in it.<br><br>A few things I've tried:- sausages, bacon, frozen Yorkshire puddings, pork chops, fish. Scampi, and yesterday crumpets.  There seems to be no limit to its versatility, my advice just keep trying things. As for Cleaning a quick rinse out, and if really necessary pop it in the dishwasher.<br><br>How people can complain about the packaging is beyond me, surely any product like this needs maximum protection during its considerable travels, I bet they would complain if it arrived damaged, its certainly not heavy or dangerous to move around compared with an old fashion deep fat fryer.  A brilliant product for the smaller household."
"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/276-9638689-5637336\">Philips HD9220 Viva Collection AirFryer--Black</a><br><br>Been looking for a fryer but hate the thought of all the oil and the Cleaning, this is it bought one and wow what a differnce in the taste of food that I have cooked, chips are fab frozen or homemade, sausages taste like they have been fried with no mess on the cooker, also being able to do things around the home whilst the food is cooking looking in now and then to give a little shake, the intructions are easy to follow as well as the Recipes that come with the product,even the Granchildren love the chips and the fish I cooked in the airfyer<br>my partner has been cooking and that is rare for him to do any cooking, he has commented what an easy be of kit, a minimum ammount of odour, a must for any kitchen with a busy lifestyles (looks very stylish sat in the corner of my kitchen) as for Cleaning very easy and even easier with a dishwasher."
"We were realy looking forward to haveing a healthier style off cooking that was versitile.  Philips is a good quality product but this particular fryer does not heat up in the time the manufacture states, the end product is good if you allow much more cooking time then what is advised.  If you use fresh potatoes for chips you will find the proces more messy than you may have intisipated."
"Great device! Potatoes comes wonderful. The oven could not become the same - just like fried are! I do not regret the purchase and recommend it to anyone looking for healthy cooked \"fried\" potatoes!<br>Apart from anything else is beautiful! This is MY device!"
"Picked up one of these last week, and was keen to see what it was like.<br>The Airfryer only took up a small area on the worktop, much smaller than our old fryer, and without all the oil sloshing about.<br>Read the instructions, and cooking time leaflet, and got perfectly cooked chips first time round.<br>Quick heat up time, only 3 mins, safety and healthier food should make this a well used product in our household going forwards."
"We purchased the Airfryer to enable my wife and I to eat food without all the added fat content. We find we can use less fat or oil when preparing food while still keeping the taste. For example oven chips can be cooked in the AirFryer while still tasting much tastier than cooked in the oven or as tasty as deep fat fried chips."
"When I bought, I thought it would be more like a machine<br>other, but since I started I started using, I have<br>impressed with the speed with which the kitchen."
"where to start . i am the kind of person that likes gadgets and loves to cook. but i had never thought to buy a fryer before because due to wanting a healthy diet not containing too much oil. How did i hear about the fryer? On the way home from holiday in november i saw an advert in the magazine given to us on the plane about the airfryer, as soon i saw the picture i liked the look of the fryer , the colour and the best thing about it was that it doesnt require any oil at all for some foods and a small amount of olive oil for others.<br>I was so excited and decided to check some reviews about the product on the internet. They were very praising of the fryer which led me to purchase it and try it out on a trial run.<br>i bought it at the begining of february and since then I have used it nearly every day and even surprised my husband  with a helthier english breakfast last sunday which he described as \"bloody good that was love\".<br>my daughter is 3 years old and never used to eat potatoes but now she asks me to cook them all the time. I was even able to make brownies in the fryer that went down very well with my work colleagues.<br>I think it may be the best purchase I have made this year. If you like fried sweet potatoes and mushrooms you will love them even more when cooked in this fryer.<br>If I was to rate this product I would give it 5 out of 5 as so far it has been a welcome surprise addtion to my kitchen."
"Just to be clear this isn't a fryer in the sense of a deep-fat fryer. This is a table-top oven that uses circulating heat waves and a small amount of oil to cook your food. This was certainly proven when I tried to make some carrot crisps, which I usually do in a pan with veg oil. What came out of the tray was burnt, uncooked in places and generally something I would be embarrassed to serve. So forget about this device if your looking for a fryer.<br><br>I also tested the AirFryer with a variety of cut chips (from a potato not from a packet, I tried thin to thick cut with the skins on). Following the instructions I got pretty much the same results each time, some cooked all the way through, some not. It doesn't really crisp up the chip, no more than an oven would do anyway. I also did some fish fingers, but then any kind of heat could cook them. I then tried to cook some chicken legs. Frequent turning is necessary as the chicken skin went black quite quickly. The results were cooked through but needed longer than the book specified to achieve this. Again, why do I need an AirFryer when I could have easily done the exact same thing in my oven.<br><br>I suppose the big question is, after it being pretty redundant as a fryer, how is this better than a conventional oven? Well its not. It's difficult to regulate as the included cook book is very hit and miss as to the results. You would have to play around with settings and timings to get the desired results. Obviously conventional cookbooks direct you for use with an oven, so you'd have to interpret the recipe for the AirFryer.<br><br>I suppose the market for this appliance is families with young kids, and as kids can't seem to get enough chicken nuggets and chips, this offers a healthy way to make them... not sure I quite understand the logic behind that. If you're that conscious of your kids diet then wouldn't you try to offer healthy alternatives rather than giving them slightly less unhealthy food? I just don't see how this device can be at all useful, even to those outside the target market. Even using the AirFryer to bake with (some Recipes like brownies etc are included though I didn't try them) the tray is too small to make anything more than three or four cakes or muffins at a time.<br><br>The AirFryer tries to be something, but hasn't quite worked out what. It's not a fryer, it's not as versatile, as large or as good as a conventional oven. It doesn't produce good results even following the book and to top it all your kitchen will be steamed out by the time your cooking is done (I had to have a window open when using it).<br><br>Sad to say that at over one hundred pounds this is not worth it. You either buy a deep fat fryer, stick with your oven or just have fried food on the occasion if your Health conscious. Can't recommend this at all."
"This is the most incredible gadget I have ever come across!! Being very diet conscious the last thing I would think I would be eating is home made chips! To 'fry' these chips in absolutely no oil but still taste amazing is a revelation!<br><br>Very stylish looking piece of equipment, you need quite a large surface area for it and despite the size it is simple to clean and easy to use. It comes with a handy recipe book and a guide to cooking times. You have the option to add a small amount of oil for the added flavour which i havent actually done yet as they taste great without but I will do and update. Best of all there's no horrible frying smell, and no mess! No oil splashes up the tiles and no danger of hot fat catching fire, you can leave it cooking and look forward to the results! I have no idea how it does what it does, but it is amazing and you can enjoy your favourite food without the guilt finally!<br><br>Could not recommend more! For any health conscious people or those who love a chip - this is simple, tastes just as good and no having to pat the excess oil off on kitchen paper which I always used to try and make myself feel better if I had a sneaky chip!<br><br>Brilliant, can't imagine being without this clever gadget now!"
"Having read so many positive reviews I decided to purchase myself an airfryer just before Christmas. I was really looking forward to the crispy chips that so many people were writing about, however so far I have not managed to get that result myself. The chips I get are either burnt or undercooked and soggy. I have tried the official instructions as well as longer and shorter timings with lots of shaking etc, I have tried pre-cooking the chips, I have tried thinner and thicker cuts and I have tried different potatoes and oils, but still no crispy chips! I have not tried any ready made oven chips from the supermarket or any other type of food, but I am starting to feel this was a waste of money. One other thing is that you can't reduce the timer once you have turned the dial. So far the only positive thing I can think of regarding this product is the ease of cleaning in the dishwasher. If anybody has a suggestion to improve my results I would be very grateful!"
"This is one of those products that I expected to either love or hate; unfortunately I feel compelled to sit on the fence and say that I am just not sure.<br><br>I have previously used an Actifry and, more recently, a deep fat fryer. This product is most closely comparable to the Actifry, measuring up well in some ways but falling short in others.<br><br>The Airfryer is a counter top fan oven. The food is cooked in a basket that is pulled out from the bottom half of the Airfryer and can be removed from the main housing for easy Cleaning (a quick soak and rub with a washing up brush is all that mine has needed).<br><br>The power cord can be pushed back into the base so that part of the storage is simple however it is also a rather large item (quite high at around 32 cm and with only a slightly smaller diameter of circa 28 cm), defying any attempts to fit in my crowded kitchen cupboards and therefore occupying valuable workspace.<br><br>A fairly inspiring recipe book is included, demonstrating that even things like cakes can be cooked in this item - but the reason for this is actually one of the failings of the product; unlike the Actifry, cooking food merely has hot air blown over it - there is no stirring mechanism incorporated. Where necessary, food needs to be manually stirred during the cooking process and this can be tricky if the basket has been filled to the maximum level and you are cooking chips, for example, for four people. Having said that, I found that oven chips came out better than they do if cooked in my fan oven (even though this is done on a specially designed tray) and small portions can (just about) come out well even if you forget to stir partway through (I have done so).<br><br>Continuing with oven chips as an example, the chunky ones that I have cooked in this invariably take around 25 minutes to cook well. This is no different to the time they take in my fan oven, so I don't find food is cooked any faster with the Airfryer.<br><br>It is a bulky item and the lack of an incorporated stirring mechanism, whilst allowing cakes to be cooked, means it can be tricky to get items to cook evenly. If you are cooking for one, this has utility as it may avoid the need to heat an entire oven but if the oven is on for other items anyway, I can't see this adds anything to the equation. Overall, I think I prefer to use my deep fat fryer (I just avoid using it very often) and fan oven."
"Great thing for calorie conscious people.<br>Very little compromise on taste, with all the battered goodies.<br>A very good buy."
"This is possibly the best kitchen item I own.  It makes chips, nuggets, scampi etc all beautifully and it takes less time than the oven.  Buy this!!! You wont regret it."
"Read all the reviews before buying this. I have to watch what I eat for medical reasons.<br>It arrived next day via CityLink & I expected it to be really heavy, but I guess that is relative & it was really easy to handle. The trick with the packaging is to cut the fastening tape, carefully invert the fryer then slide off the packing. Moving heavy object from packing is the wrong way round. Years of unpacking computers has taught me this.<br><br>In use, for us as a couple it is great & very much a case of experimentation with different potatoes, wedges, chips, oils & flavourings-you can't 'set it & forget it' like a 'normal' fryer. However, the results are absolutely great-the best chips & wedges we've ever tasted-the fish & chip recipe from the recipe booklet is great & our Friday night treat. We've also tried halved tomatoes & oil-brushed mushrooms for a low-fat accompaniment. When we do chips or wedges for 4 & the pan is full that takes more care & more time & for a large family needing bigger quantities I would imagine the fryer could be quite frustrating.<br><br>In conclusion, this is a great bit of kit (easy to clean in dishwasher or hot, soapy soak) and we've eaten more chips & wedges this year than the past 5 years-healthy & great flavours."
"Having purchased the Airfryer with the hopes of attaining that perfect crispy chip without added oil, I have been left completely unsatisfied and will now think twice about purchasing any other Philips products.<br><br>I don't like the style, hate the fact that I can't see my food cooking and that you really are limited on where you can store it or even place it on your kitchen bench! It is too tall for all my cupboards and as the power cord is so short I had to completely rearrange my kitchen in order to use it. It is incredibly heavy! 10kgs! My microwave weighs half this!<br><br>It is super noisy when Pre-heating - my house mate came investigating upon hearing the noise and eyeing the black box asked why I was using star wars props in the kitchen? I mean really! Yet the buzzer that sounds the end of cooking time is super quite, you can't have the TV going or be out of the kitchen as you will not hear it go off.<br><br>I found that the airfryer left chicken and vegetable quite dry. I even attempted to bake using the airfryer  but having to find a cake tin that fits is rather hard! And was very concerned over how high my bread might rise as the basket isn't very deep!<br><br>Now as I initially purchased this with the intention of cooking low fat chips having now tried in the airfryer I would rather use my conventional oven as the airfryer doesn't evenly spread heat. Not to mention the fact that the cooking times for chips varied across the box packaging, the recipe guide and the labels on the airfryer itself!<br><br>And as far as safety in the kitchen is concerned, when you pull out the basket to toss / check your food the heat still keeps pumping out! At least with my conventional oven I can shut the door! This is not a product to have in your house if you have children! Not to mention the fact that the baskets release catch is at the top of the handle and more than once whilst in the process of removing my food managed to hit the release accidently and the sold metal box dropped to the floor , the first time hitting my foot! This is a hot metal box! Again DO NOT use this product if you have children around!<br><br>Over all I was deeply dissatisfied with this product, I felt that it was all talk and no action especially for what it costs! I would not recommend this to anyone."
"Have you ever tasted a raw potato? That's what air-fried chips taste like. They just don't compare with deep-fried chips.<br><br>I was disappointed. The Philips AirFryer is OK for heating up some food but a normal oven or a microwave does it better, more evenly.<br><br>Don't waste your money on this. The price has dropped 25% since I bought one a month ago."
"Whilst this is smaller than the Tefal Actifry (or at least seems to be), it does a better job of root vegetables like parsnips, sweet potato etc. The Tefal leaves them soggy, but this seems to produce a crisper end product. This is also better for more fragile food. Other than that, there's little to differentiate them. Both do passable chips."
"A FANTASTIC PRODUCT. FRIES WITH ALMOST NO OIL. CHOPS, HAMBURGERS, NUGGETS ALL COOKED PERFECTLY WITH MUCH LESS CALORIES THAN FRIED BUT WITH FANTASTIC TASTE."
"well made and works well. does things like chicken drumsticks and many more, but does not do chips as good as fried chips, after saying that I still think they are not too bad and cooking is quick with no fuss. plenty space needed for storage. all in all, we like it"
"loved the flavour when making potato chips with a teaspoon of cooking oil instead of a pint of oil, much healthier."
"I wanted a healthy option for a \"fryer\" and must say it is better than I thought. I had to try chips a couple of time to find my liking, but used a drop or two more oil, still a lot less than a traditional fryer, and less than an actifry. Clean and nice looking, no after smells, I cook for 3 adults, not sure for a larger family. Easy to look after, only the basket and pan,to wash. no spills, grease steam, Very pleased with my purchase!"
"Can across this as a brilliant healthy option for frying and could not believe the results. I'll never eat from a fat fryer again!  Sleek and attractive on the worktop and gets people talking in the kitchen. Roasties are quicker and just as sumptuous as if they had been cooked in the oven.  We're converts!"
"This is a great little machine it can cook chips to cooking cake with great results<br>It is great i cannot say anymore than that"
"Yes it's true.  With this machine I can make light and fluffy, hardly any fat at all doughnuts.  It hardly merits comment in comparison to splitting the atom or finding a cure for the common cold, but I've always had a weakness for doughnuts and now I can make them a guilt free treat.  Tempura, crispy croutons, thick chunky chips, the list of mouth watering delicacies that are no longer off-limits is endless.  Top Tip use coconut oil to cook - it has a higher burn point than other oils and is generally way healthier than multi purified vegetable oil.<br><br>A great machine - enjoy!"
"realy impressed with this product, no need to fill frier with oil, just coat the food very lightly with oil, then fry, healthier eating all round, i use it for frozen chips mostly, no oil needed at all with these and they turn out nice and crispy. would reccomend this frier to anyone."
"The Tefal oil free fryers motor blew one month after the guarantee ended, so we tried the Philips AirFryer.  So far which has not been alot, we have found the Philips quicker, quieter but we have not yet mastered the Quality....Angus"
"We had been thinking about trying one of these for ages, and with the offer from Philips for a full money back guarantee we had to try it.<br>It seemed to be well made, felt reasonably robust, easy to understand, and we gave it a go. We made home made chips, just like it says it will do - \"best home made chips without the oil\" I think is what Philips say. We followed the instructions to the letter, with oil, a little shaking etc and were left with disappointing chips, burnt in places, almost raw in others. We tried again, with other varieties of potatoes, but with equally disappointing results.<br>We finally tried over chips, and hey-presto, they seemed quite good. But wait a minute - that is not what we wanted it for. There had to be more to it than just doing over chips. Ok, so does hash browns reasonably well too, but the best tasting home made chips without the oil were totally disappointing. All this is is a tiny little desk top oven. It does NOT do what it says on the box. We gave it more than a fair chance, and eventually decided that we would just have our money back as it just did not live up to what it said it would.<br>Don't just take my word for it though, try it, and then send it back. We did get our money back, no questions, no problems."
"Wow.....now there was a pleasant surprise. In an effort to try and become healthy whilst satisfying a frequent craving for chips, the Philips AirFryer seemed to be the perfect weapon of choice. Yes it was expensive and there were some negative reviews but on the whole the good far outweighed the bad so I decided to take the plunge and to be honest I don't look back.<br><br>Gone are the days where my gas oven used to be on for up to 40 minutes, warming up to the right temperature and then actually cooking .... Trying to achieve the perfect chip was always challenging with varying results and baking trays being ruined through pre covered oil found on most oven chips. Now life is simple, I turn on my AirFryer, set the timer and by the time I return from the freezer with my chips it's reached the target temperature (Less than 3 minutes to reach 200 degrees, far quicker than most ovens and other types of fryers to my knowledge). I open the sliding drawer, pop the chips in the basket then close it. (Note, for oven chips you don't have to even put any oil in the fryer). After about 7 minutes I simply pull out the drawer, shake it to break up the chips in the basket and then pop them back in. After anther 7 minutes the timer pings and my chips are ready to perfection. Ok I admit, it only pings once which is not ideal but everything shuts down once the timer has gone off so if you don't hear it, your food won't keep cooking and get ruined and if you know your cooking something that takes less then 15 minutes, even if you don't hear the ping your going to be watching the time anyhow and let's be honest old fashioned egg timers never made any sound but I still managed to get the results I needed. Note your cooking time will vary depending on the quantity of food in your basket but there is a guideline that comes with your AirFryer and as they say practice does make perfect.<br><br>I have also read that some people think that the AirFryer is noisy, well to be honest its not quiet, but it makes a lot less noise than my current fan oven and its also running for a fraction of the time so overall is a lot less annoying and probably saving money on my existing utility bills.  Other reviews also say its really big, again I would have to question this and say in comparison to what, a hand blender, Yes and cake mixer or slow cooker No. I have a small kitchen and it fits perfectly in the corner of the worktop and with its slick black finish sometimes it's hardly noticeable. Other things I also really like are the easy cord storage that feeds into the base and allows me to conceal any unnecessary cable plus the fact that if all the hard work of cooking exhausts me and I can't manage to wash up, the main drawer and basket of the fryer are both dishwasher proof. Life truly is tuff these days.<br><br>Overall this is a perfect gadget for impatient fast food lovers that are looking to satisfy their indulgences in a quicker time with healthier results. The AirFryer does also come with a recipe booklet containing great examples of other things you can cook apart from chips showing you its true versatility so I'll let you know how I get on....  In addition to this though if you are still not convinced Philips are offering a 60 day buy back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose....."
"We purchased an Air Fryer recently and attempted to make chips,<br>This being the main  reason we wanted one. I didn't say anything to my wife and she<br>Didn't give an opinion to me.  To be honest I thought the chips were very poor with little flavour, and<br>Not what we wanted. When my wife gave her verdict it was the same as mine<br>I don't say the product is poor, but don't think it is for us. Perhaps other people will find it OK but we have returned<br>Ours in favour of our deep fat fryer, as against the Air Fryer, I dont think there is any comparison.<br><br>."
"Surprisingly good chips and noe of the lingering smell that my old deep fat fryer left for days. Have not tried anything else yet, but am pleased with the speed and texture of the chips. My husband has given them the thumbs up too."
"Not only for low fat chips, but chicken, fish, quiche, roasted veg (peppers, parsnips etc)and flat breads that are usually fried. Can not believe that there is NO taste difference - and on oven baked stuff, you only use a fraction of the oven space so heating up is done so much quicker. Husband dropped the base - cost me another £40, but the part arrived promptly."
"I absolutely LOVE chips in any form but the idea of using and reusing cooking oil is not the healthy option. This appliance cooks chips beautifully with only a smattering of oil so they are not only delicious, easy and fast to cook; they are also much lower in calories than any chips could be. The Recipes on-line are versatile and tasty from pre-drinks nibbles to samosas and hors d'oevres. The AirFryer also cooks potatoes in every which way -roast, croquettes,au gratin to name a few. I was amazed that it had the added bonus of cooking bread and cakes. What more do you want from a cooker?! It is a MUST in every kitchen."
"conventional deep fat fryers are known for their convenience. But how convenient are they really? They cost so much in oil, and are a nightmare to clean, and on top of that...disposing of the oil is a pain in the arse (blocks the drains once it hardens!). Then along comes the airfryer to show all the other fryers how its done. No oil, no mess - healthy, and cheap to run. You literally pop it out the box give it a wipe and turn it on.<br><br>So there must be a catch right? Surely the food tastes bad I hear you ask? Not at all! The food tastes better than any fryer could achieve - crisp on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. And once you're done there is next to no mess, just wipe down and you are ready to go again.<br><br>One day, all food will be airfried..."
"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/276-9638689-5637336\">Philips AirFryer Healthier Oil-Free Fryer</a> Excellent product -we are really pleased with it and feel like it is definitely cooking in a healthier way needing very little oil.It is also much less time consuming for the actual cooking process than traditional methods."
"I was a bit sceptical when considering this purchase but I need not have worried.<br>No oil to buy, no messy, dirty oil to change, easy to clean.<br><br>I have had my fryer, (actually it is not a fryer more an oven/grill), for a little over a month and to date havr cooked chips, (of course), chicken nuggets, burgers,<br>fish fingers and onion rings with excellent results. I guess that it is more cost effective to run as there is no oil to heat and cooking time is relatively short.<br><br>Would recomend highly and hope that my shares in Philips increase!"
"Purchased this product, as I currently make the 'syn free' chips in the oven{which have to be par-boiled also}and I wanted to see if it was as good as it was reviewed on here, and so far, I am very pleased with the results!! I have done oven chips for the rest of the family{no oil} and they gave the thumbs up,also fish fingers cooked lovely and crispy in it. when i done my syn free chips, I use a small amount of oil,as that was much better results and half way I give them a good shake, not too noisy when cooking, and no smells,like a fryer!! I will take this in my motorhome when we go away,so I can make chips!!glad I bought this rather than the tefal actifry,easy to clean out,and for best results turn the air fryer on for a few mins to pre-heat,as that cooks items really well, comes with a good little receipe book as well. the only moan I had,was when it came,the box was soo big!!! but that is philip,s fault, to much packaging. brilliant purchase, love using it."
"Hello, I just wanted to say how impressed I am with my Philips Airfryer.<br><br>I have had it just over a month now and have used it in a large number of different situations, from cooking self made chips and garlic mushrooms to frozen foods all with impressive results. I'm sure my oven chips even taste better when done in the airfryer. There are no unpleasant odours, and I don't own a dishwasher so it needs to be really easy to clean and it is, a little soak in hot soapy water and a gentle wipe, all done.<br><br>My six year old boy enjoys making chips or seasoned potato cubes and I can relax in the knowledge that there isn't a big pan of boiling hot oil sat on the side.<br><br>Another big plus for me is that there is no real warm up time compared to the conventional oven which can take anything from 15 to 20 minutes to reach temperature, most foods that I have cooked in my airfryer are done in that time.<br><br>I would recommend this product to anyone, 10/10 well done Philips well worth the money."
"Like many reviewers, initially I was quite impressed with the unit. It's a solid item that feels like it's a quality product. It looks good in glossy black and fitted in perfectly with our kitchen.<br><br>But on to the cooking. The first point is that you'll need to experiment with cooking times. I found the times in the booklet a little short. It's best to let the unit heat up for a short period before putting the food in. Items such as oven chips cook really well but what's the point when you can put them in the oven. Also the basket is a bit small despite the size of the unit so you're a bit limited in terms of quantity. The final point is that you definitely need to give the basket a number of shakes during the cooking process otherwise the food cooks unevenly.<br><br>Overall it's a reasonable product but to be honest I can't see us using it particularly often. I might experiment with different foods but nowadays most food that you might have cooked in a deep fat fryer years ago can be done in the oven as food manufacturers have moved away from deep fried food. The only exception is if you're making food from fresh ingredients and frying is the only way of cooking it.<br><br>If you frequently fry food then it's worth a go otherwise I wouldn't bother."
"Like many others leaving a review on this item I also have had a Tefal Actifry previously, within 2 months the lid latch broke and 6 months later the paddle broke, but all in all we were happy with the food from it. We were then going to order parts or get a new one, looking on amazon I found the philips airfry, and WOW!!!<br>Just made frozen chips for our daughter, 3 mins warm up, 12 mins with a shake halfway at 200c and perfect crunchy chips with soft fluffy centre. That never happened on the actifry. We have not tried fresh chips yet, but on early results we are very happy and are extremely glad we chose the philips instead of the tefal.<br>If your unsure, believe me, this is the one to go for."
"I've been using this AirFryer for a few months now, and it is a useful piece of kit. It's essentially a healthier substitute for a deep-fat fryer, which uses some sort of 'air-frying' technique to fry food using much less oil. The benefits of this are fairly obvious; it's healthier and much less wasteful of oil. On top of that, the chips it produces are very tasty, though no matter what I do I can't seem to replicate the Belgian/French style fries that the side of the box seems to promote. The type of potato you use can make a big difference to how chips come out, and you must prepare them properly in order to get them as crisp as possible. The product comes with a crudely assembled recipe booklet, which offers a few decent recipes as an introduction to using the AirFryer but nothing more than that. Combined with the brief set of instructions, you'll probably find that you do most of your learning by trial and error.<br>One of the downsides to this product is the size - it is MASSIVE. If you have a small kitchen then you may struggle to find somewhere to store it when you're not using it. It also only has a relatively small basket to cook food in, considering how big the actual cooker is.<br>Another downside is that you have to make sure your chips are completely dry before cooking them if you want them to end up crispy - though they never end up quite like proper deep-fried french fries.<br>If you like homemade chips but want a healthier alternative to a deep-fat fryer then this will do the job just fine. It's big, it's noisy, but it makes lovely, healthy chips."
"Excellent family fryer. I was optomistic when purchasing this healthy fryer. I have had the fryer for nearly a year and I can say without doubt that it is a good all round fryer and well worth the money despite what other reviewers may of claimed. The instructions with the machine are clear. By using the fryer often, it is reliable and does what it claims. The fryer is easy to use and to clean."
"Great product - very pleased with my purchase.  Free food chips on Slimming World are quick and easy with my fryer.  No nasty smells in the kitchen - highly recommend."
"although being a little dubious about the manufacturers claims for this product i was more than pleasantly surprised at the results especially chips but i have also cooked other food ie. chicken fish jacket potatoes even savoury stuffing balls.It is also a great deal cleaner and safer than deep fat frying. Iwould reccomend this product to anyone especially at the vastly dicounted price offered on the AMAZON SITE."
"The Philips Air Fryer is fanastic.  I haven't got as far as baking Brownies in it yet - but vegetables and chips are fanastic and very healthy, especially for those trying to cook with little oil. The basket is easy to clean and there is no mess. It is a little noisy and like other reviewers have said you must take care with the basket when removing it from the base.  But overall I would thoroughly recommend it."
"This machine has changed my life!! I am a big fan of chips but never have them for Health reasons, well worry no more with this wonderful machine!!! Quick and easy and you can put the tray and basket in the dishwasher, which is great.  I have found that cooking the chips twice is best, so if you have time, do them for 10 mins before you are due to eat.  Then 10mins before you are serving up, put them on for another 10mins then you will have perfect chips!  I also recommend using the packets of potato wedge flavourings, just add half a teaspoon of the seasoning when you are using your spray oil or olive oil before you put them in.  Perfect!  Best price around was from Amazon.  I highly recommend this product."
"I looked for a long time at the Tefal Actifry but decided against due to it's reliability issues as stated by a number of users. I've only had the Philips for a number of weeks but can confer with other users that it does the job well. I don't particularly like crispy chips and have found that by turning the thermostat down to 180 and not the recommended 200, chips come out softer and more to my taste. I've tried all shapes and sizes of chips and various potatoe varieties and they all turn out very tasty. If cooking for one, then you can cook a piece of battered frozen cod at the same time-both done a treat in 15 minutes. Quite a bit quicker than the usual oven method. I've also tried cooking chicken legs which cooked ok but did take longer than recomended times.The machine is easy to clean provided cooked food has not stuck to the basket wire. Overall am pleased with the machine so far."
"i love this airfry it is a healthy way of cooking cannot believe the heat it cooks with it is so easy and the chips lovely and tasty as are roast pots you just put it in and let it get on with it i love the black and it sits in the corner of my kitchen looking very posh i dont find it noisy and have not done a load of cooking in it as not had that long but it so easy to use wash up and tasty with it great value"
"In all honesty, we were sceptical about this product....we have an AGA, a deep fat fryer and a microwave and couldn't really see a place for this in the kitchen....until we got one and used it for the first time!  Now it is part of our 'must have' kitchen equipment (even rescuing us the other weekend from disaster when the AGA packed up - it cooked the roast potatoes and yorkshire pudding perfectly (yes really!!)  Actually, probably a better result than we would have got in the AGA.<br>We had small children to stay last week & it was perfect for cooking little homemade chicken nuggets, the ubiquitous chips (as others have already said) and more.  The best part is the speed - home with the children, supper for them on the table in a few minutes and minimal Cleaning up.<br>We all love the occasional chip-fest but in these days of consciously cutting down on fat, our deep fat fryer has been consigned to the back of the cupboard, never seeing the light of day.  Apart from the guilt aspect, the emptying of the oil and tiresome Cleaning is enough to put anyone off frying chips in a deep fat fryer.  Now, with the Philips airfryer, (almost!) guilt free chips can be made quickly and cleanly - perfect.<br>Really, with an AGA which is hot all the time (apart from when it gives up the ghost with everyone seated at the table!) the airfryer is a lovely addition to the kitchen...if you have an 'ordinary' oven I would say it's a kitchen essential - no need to put the oven on specially,  wait for it to heat up and use all that energy...just pre-heat the airfryer, and you're good to go - dinner in minutes.  Highly recommended."
"I have had this fryer for just 3 weeks now, but I am so happy with it I want to write a review. I guess one of its main uses for a lot of people will be to make chips; I have already tried wedges, chips and potato cubes. The skin was left on the wedges and I felt they didn't 'crisp up'. But the chips and cubes are very very good - lovely crispy edges with nicely cooked centres (I'm sure the wedges would be great too with a bit of tweaking). The fryer is very quick too, being up to temperature in about 2 minutes and being relatively quick to cook. All that is needed is to coat chips with minimal oil and give a quick shake after 5 minutes or so.<br>I have used it for other things too - fish fingers, onion bhajis, filled potato skins and fishcakes. All were crispy on the outside and hot through. This highlights one of the main benefits of this fryer. It is more like a mini oven, with an element like an electric cooker ring and a fan to disperse the heat evenly. This means that it is much quicker to do these sorts of foods than wait on your oven to preheat and then heat your food. I have prepared all these foods so far without looking at the instructions and Recipes provided, so I'm keen to look at those to find out the full extent of its capabilities.<br>I have never owned a deep fat fryer due to the fat content, but I do like fried food! If you are like me then this is the perfect product for you. And because it acts as an oven too then it has been well used so far. I have used it more in 3 weeks than a bread maker I have had for 6 years. Finally, it looks good (mine is black) and there are virtually no cooking smells."
"i have just purchased the phillips air fryer and i am really pleased with it, you can cook anything in it and it all tastes so good, i would recomend this item"
"Absolutely brilliant.  Easy to operate, easy to clean.  Do not even have to use any oil for sausages, chips etc.  Cooks frozen fish and chips exactly how we like them.  Wouldn't be without it."
"I hate oven baked chips.....chips should be chips.  The frozen variety in the Airfryer are great and the best thing is that home made fries are even better.  Am buying it for my parents for Christmas.  Great buy"
"The best money I have spent in years what a fantastic product guilt free perfect chips every time I love the Phillips airfryer It's so easy to use even my other half can cook chips it's used three or four times a week I've not tried anything else in it yet"
"We sent this back under the 60 days refund we found it did not cook as we thought it would and it was noisy. the chips were better done in the oven."
"Does a great job,create the perfect chips.<br>a lot healthier for us all and cooks numerous other items to perfection, expensive item but on weighing up high cost of replacement oil this will pay for itself in no time, if your thinking of buying one.. stop thinking n do it!\"<br>I am very Happy with this Airfryer."
"easy to use and produces great chips with little oil and no mess. Maybe a bit pricey but well worth the money. Not too noisy."
"I am impressed that it is so easy to keep clean. The chips do take longer to cook than what the instructions say, also there are no smells in the house, that is a big bonus. Overall I am very pleased with the product."
"Very pleased with my purchase. I find 20mins to do a family of 4 gives you great chips, always give a couple of shakes to the basket and to get them evenly brown. I don't use any oil. Great value from Amazon"
"I haven't had my airfryer long so haven't experimented with Recipes yet but what I have cooked has turned out exactly how it says on the box. the food is cooked evenly and takes half the time of conventional cooking. if you are looking for a healthier diet I would recommend this appliance."
"Well, I think I must be using an entirely different product from the one a couple of people here are describing.  The whole point of the airfryer is that is that it uses a fraction of the oil that deep frying requires and is, therefore, a whole lot healthier.<br><br>I have had my airfryer for three months now and found it to be an invaluable piece of kitchen equipment, not like a lot of other gadgets I have bought over the years.<br><br>I experimented with chips and found a method that is foolproof and produces delicious chips which are enjoyed by my grandchildren and whole family.<br><br>You can prepare the chips in advance and soak them in cold water which helps to remove the starch.  When you are ready to make the chips change the water in the pan you have been soaking the chips in, bring them to a boil and simmer for 2 - 3 minutes so that the outside is very slightly cooked, drain thoroughly until dry and shake the pan vigourously to roughen the outside of the chips ever so slightly. Add the suggested amount of oil and sprinkle lightly with semolina whilst shaking to coat well.  You can also experiment with adding paprika, salt or dried garlic at this point.<br><br>Whilst frying the chips shake the pan halfway through the cooking time.  I initially put them in on 200 for 10 minutes.  Depending on what sort of potatoes you use you might need another 5 minutes.  I defy anyone to say these chips are not delicious. My grandchildren adore them and I feel I am giving them a healthy food which I wouldn't if they were deep fried.<br><br>I have used the airfryer for other things and they have all turned out well. Roast potatoes in goose fat are gorgous and you only need a little bit of the melted fat to coat them.  I do think you have to experiment and not give up after the first try.  I have just ordered the pan which fits inside so am looking forward to trying lots of other foods in the near future.  There is a cookery book which comes with the airfryer but there are not many recipes in it.  I hope one soon becomes available, if not I will have to write one!!!!<br><br>I would say to anyone who can afford them ~ and they are available much more cheaply now ~ to go ahead and buy one if you have the room on your worktop to accommodate it as it takes a bit of room, much like a food processor. I don't think you will be disappointed, I certainly wasn't."
"The item was bought to replace an older airfryer, the difference is quite noticable the chips are far crispier and other products created in the unit cook well are less fatty with all the taste of the foods preserved, would highly recommend this unit as part of a health eating habit."
"We visited my Son in Singapore and he had just purchased a Philips Airfryer  we were so impressed with it,when we got back home we orderd one.<br>We use it 2/3 times a week would recomend to any one no oil no fat required very healthy a very very good buy."
"I bought the Philips air fryer to replace my deep fat fryer in order to comply with a change in my tenancy agreement.  With the deep fat fryer the process of making home made chips required merely peeling and chopping the potatoes and dropping the in the fryer.  With the Philips air fryer the process is a bit more involved.  After having been chopped into shape your chips will need to be patted dry with a paper towel or similar and then oiled prior to cooking.  The manual also recommends soaking the chips for 30 minutes prior to drying and oiling them but I have found this to make little difference and no longer bother with this stage.  On the plus side the resulting chips are crisper than those I cooked using a deep fat fryer and are presumably healthier too.  Also my flat-mates have been impressed with how well the air fryer cooks oven chips (which are what it is actually designed for) and it is less smelly and easier to clean than the deep fat fryer."
"What an ingenious piece of equipment.  I have not had the fryer for too long, but what I have cooked in it so far, has not been a disappointment.  All those lovely \"fatty\" treats like chips, I can now have, and not feel as guilty as I used to.  What I love about it, is there is no lingering smell of greasy oil in every room.  Just a quick wash and it is ready for the next delightful dish you want to cook.  Chicken is especially good.  Well worth purchasing."
"Got this as i am doing slimming world and i miss having chips and its not worth putting on the big oven to make them i can now have chips etc any tine i want in 15 mins it is a brillant machine and i would not be without it now.<br>I also do other things in it for the rest of the family like spring rolls, quiche,oven chips etc and a tip for you all you can get a set of 4 dishes in lakeland that fit perfectly for £11."
"I've bought the Air-fryer just over a month ago and it very quickly became the most used item in my kitchen.<br>The potato chips and wedges come out great without failing.  My husband loves chips and he agrees that in the air-fryer they come out nicer than in the oven and healthier.<br><br>I've also tried roast vegetables which came out great and spring-rolls were a great hit.  The desapeared as soon as I moved them to a plate.  Good thing that they take just a few minutes to air-gry...<br><br>Highly recommended product!"
"very fast delivery , have tried out product for a day or two now,<br>  never again will we go back to the deep fat fryers ,<br>  this is a beautiful machine ,it does as it says on the box,<br>  little tip ,par boil your  potatoes for a miute or two,<br>  dry off ,coat lightly in olive oil , BEST ROAST POTATOES EVER<br>  no fat grease , very dry & fluffy ,easy to clean ,more or less a two minute job,<br>  was a bit dubious at first new fangled machine that end up in the cupboard,<br>  but philips have got this right, brilliant<br>  norrie"
"How unlucky can one be, I ordered 1 Phillips Airfryer yesterday afternoon, then I thought I'd order 1 for my daughter-in-law for Christmas this afternoon, only to find the price had dropped by over £13.I suppose you win some you lose some!!<br>  Jean Peters"
"Arrived in good time and in good condition..<br><br>Very quick to get to grips with having only 2 controls, the timer and the temperature..<br><br>Only done chips in it so far, own make and frozen oven chips, both tasted good and the frozen ones cooked quicker and looked better"
"I THINK IT IS BRILL, I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WOULD RECOMMEND IT, CLEAN AND easy to use GREAT CHIPS HAD NO PROBLEMS DONE AS IT SAYS ON THE TIN"
"This is one of the best products I have ever bought,Its so easy to use The chips are fantastic and so are the jacket potatoes.<br>Please do follow the instructions (soak the chips or the potatoes in water) before cooking<br>I have even cooked the whole sunday dinner in it (so healthy) brill for my diet<br>I use it for almost every meal i cook now FANTASTIC PRODUCT"
"A Little sceptical when i ordered the fryer, but i thought give it a go, sounds to good to be true.<br>But what a surprise to find it not only does what it says on the tin so to speak but a lot more besides.<br>Still trying new Recipes with it and finding it copes with all i have tossed at it. with flying colours.<br>Potatoes wise there is nothing it cannot do, Fish, meat does them all, but can sometimes make chicken a little dry, needs a coating to allow enough moisture to last the cooking time. Will do whole meals for one in a fraction of the time, of other methods.<br>Absolutely brilliant keep up the good work Philips.<br>Have recommended this item to friends and family.<br><br>Scores 11 out of 10 for our family, in use every day."
"We've had this for a about three or four weeks now, and I am only giving it four stars because it does a pretty  good job of what it's designed to do. But even so, I must admit that I am still struggling a bit to see what it does that our fan oven can't. The airfryer only circulates hot air, which is what a fan oven does. I agree that it can make lovely home made chips which are crunchy on the outside and soft inside, but it's an expensive chip maker unless you eat chips several times a day.<br>So far my wife has used it mainly to cook meals for the kids and it is pretty convenient and fast to cook for two small kids who occaisionally want chicken nuggets and chips for lunch. But what it does that our fan oven won't is a little bit of a mystery to me, apart from the Speed of cooking with it. I was hoping to throw away our deep fat fryer after buying this, as part of a general diet cleanup for the family, but I still see a need for the fryer for certain things, even though it is used very rarely. For instance I can't see how you could put a piece of battered fish in this without the batter dripping out of the pan, which the bottom of has holes like a sieve. But we've cooked chicken pieces in it that came out very nice and moist, although not so brown. OK, maybe we did it incorrectly and there is a way of browning without overcooking, but we're still quite new at this. I also once cooked chips and fish nuggets for four people and almost filled the basket, but the bits in the middle were not cooked so well and needed further cooking. So it's not a great idea to fill up the basket.<br><br>Would I have bought it knowing what I know now ? I guess so, only my expectations wouldn't have been as high as they were, and I would maybe not have been in such a hurry to buy one as I was. As far as health benefits go, I do see how it's better for the kids if my wife sticks sausages/nuggets/chips in the airfryer rather than using a frying pan with lots of oil, although those kinds of things can also go in the oven. But I noticed that she used to use the frying pan a lot for speed and convenience to quickly cook a small bite to eat for the kids, which is where the airfryer wins big over an oven or frying pan, i.e. quick (no need to wait for oven to pre-heat) and also cooks faster than a fan oven at the same temperature, far less oil if any at all, and a far healthier way of cooking than the frying pan.<br><br>Will your life or kitchen be incomplete without one ? No. Is it convenient ? Very much so, especially if you have one or two kids. Just please be aware of what this actually is/does before you buy. For us the main driver for using it is an almost healthy version (or certainly not bad) of traditionally fried food for the kids, all usually done in 10-15 minutes and no oven trays to clean. What's not to like about that ?"
"It is so easy to use if you can press start on a microwave then you can cook with your eyes shut with this air fryer.<br>I wish it had come with the baking tray !!. I find frozen crinkle cut chips / Chunky Croquette Potatoes / Chicken Kive & Fish works well, they are crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth.I cooked home made chips just once but did not leave them in water for the required time because i was showing it to to a friend the chips looked a bit bland but they were impressed with the taste but had not seen the quality of the frozen ones. We put a full pack of frozen sausages in ( NOT IN PACKET ) and they cooked in 16/20 mins. If I had grilled from frozen the skins would look dryed out and take a lot longer but not in the Air Fryer. I have tried some meats and they cook well. When you cook just check that the outside is crisp and inside should be done. Any fat is in the bottom of the pan and not on the food.If you forget and leave it on , the house won't burn down and i so easy to clean even a man can do it. Well I did.<br>Gareth"
"This is a great product. Slightly expensive but worth it on health grounds. It is non fat deep frying. some small amount of oil for some Recipes but is a must for healthy eating people.<br>Delivery is a problem if it done by Yodel which in the last 4 times I have purchased  on line from different company's Yodel have failed to deliver on said day. They even lie to say they have left a card when they have not. A totally crap company who should not be used by amazon or anyone else."
"my wife & I recently purchased this item & we have found after a bit of trial & error that the food is done to our liking. We would recomend it to our family & friends"
"I bought myself plus my three married children a Philips AirFryer and all are pleased!!! It was my 86 year old mother who first bought one and started our interest......so easy to use!! I got for a good price on Amazon and quick delivery so pleased all round.. Avril"
"Not what was expected after seeing the various adverts on TV, lots of fiddly preparation needed, spreading oil etc over the foods before cooking,A deep fat fryer does the same thing without any pre cooking preparation."
"I ordered this product but never received it so the only reveiw I can give is a bad one, it has been a month now and if I ever get it I will review it.I have made endless enquireis at amazon and no one seems interested, so this reveiw i somthing of a own goal for amazon.<br>  Regards C.E.Reeve."
"We have had this unit a few weeks now and foung it to be every bit as good as it claims. It cooks superb chips and we particularly like Mediteraneum vegetables prepared in it. Fantastic peice of equipment,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/276-9638689-5637336\">Philips AirFryer Healthier Oil-Free Fryer</a>"
"absolute brilliant, so glad i bought this , its changed the way i cook and eat. so easy to use, not a bit oily or greasy!!!"
"This machine is great, 3 mins to heat up. All fast drips to the bottom of the unit really healthy. Recommend 10 out of 10."
"brilliant thats all i can say really.<br>its great not to have to use oil and the guidlines are correct for cooking times"
"This is a truly excellent piece of kit! It cooks quickly and very evenly, so long as you shake the basket (as per manufacturer instructions)- only a brief shake a couple of times - no pancake style flipping is necessary! I have not found it difficult to relocate the basket either into its holder or into the body of the machine, it's just a knack to learn. The price is VERY variable, so it's well worth spending time checking various outlets/sites; I saved nearly 40%. I would definitely advise buying the version that comes with the baking accessory as I'm having difficulty sourcing it separately from Philips (the website constantly says 'out of stock' though they have reduced its price for the January sales - you just can't actually buy it!)<br>I have no hesitation in recommending the airfryer, both for baking from fresh or frozen, the food retains its moisture and doesn't go hard compared to oven baking and it genuinely scarcely needs oil to give the fried effect. My family are fussy eaters, but are completely in agreement about the excellence of this gadget. As it is not too large (easily fitting under my upper kitchen units) I'm actually considering buying a SECOND one (with the baking accessory included!) as it is only large enough to cook four portions of anything at once. The divider works well for cooking protein one side and veg the other, but really only enough to feed two people (unless you are much stronger willed than we are at resisting delicious food.) I've found it particularly useful for producing puddings without having to be nipping in and out of the kitchen during a meal, as it cooks so quickly that starting it at the same time as clearing main course plates has allowed me to spend more time enjoying the meal, too.<br>Be aware, the black version is a large chunk of solid black and does look rather like Darth Vader's helmet - and indeed makes a not dissimilar noise - so if you have a very light and bright kitchen, you may well prefer the white version. My advice is BUY IT! BUY IT!"
"Really pleased with this air fryer,can be used for all sorts of frying not just chips.Preferred it to the Tefal Actifry as you are restricted with the Actifry as to what you can cook due to the paddle.Does seem to take longer than stated though to cook the food.A great product which saves you turning on the large oven for many meals.Can highly recommend!"
"This a really great addition to the kitchen. I have done the chips both with and without oil and all the results are very tasty. The calorie saving is excellent with no loss of flavour or texture. And as for items such as toasted almonds, chestnuts etc. and mixed vegetable dishes it really does a perfect job."
"Im not one for doing reviews but I feel I need to say just how happy I am with this product !<br>I was a little sceptical due to some of the reviews on here. Some people had said it does not cook the food even etc.<br>After a few weeks contemplating this purchase, I decided to buy one knowing that I can return it to Phillips within 60 days for a full refund.<br>I need not of worried............ its pure brilliance !<br>I started with some oven chips, just to see how they come out and I was quite happy with the results, however, the main reason I got this was to be able to have my own homemade chips without the oil. I stuck to the instructions, did a max weight of 800g (I found this could easily feed 3 adults) I soaked them in water for 30 mins, dried them with kitchen roll, added a small amount of olive oil and popped them in the airfryer.<br>The results far exceeded my expectations ! I thought they came out great and tasted very nice !<br>Over the last 6 weeks I have started to experiment with the fryer, I have found it does not really make a difference if you soak the chips or not, as long as you dry them, they seem to come out the same. I have also come to the conclusion that the chips need to be shaken frequently during cooking, I tend to give them a quick shake every 10 mins, just to make sure all the chips get an even cook and also stops them from sticking together during cooking.<br>I have also tried vegetables; Mushrooms, Carrots, Courgette, Parsnip, Turnip and so on, again all have come out far better than I thought they would !<br>Im now totally hooked on the airfryer and its turned into one of the most used appliances in my kitchen, even my husband is pleased with the results.<br>Overall best purchase I ever made, totally worth every penny !"
"product does everything as advertised and more we find something else to do with it every time we use it price was also very good"
"THIS PRODUCT, AND I SUSPECT OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS, ARE NOTHING MORE THAN MINI FAN ASSISTED OVENS.<br>THEY SUPPOSEDLY MAKE THE BEST HOME MADE CHIPS EVER. WHAT A LAUGH, THEY ARE DRY AND TASTELESS.<br>TAKE MY TIP, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"Do yourself a favour and get one of these - it actually does what it says on the tin!  It may sound like a gimmick but it is not."
"Well I bought the airfryer because my son refused to eat oven chips,saying they tasted like burnt cardboard,I hate Cleaning deep fat fryers and the actifryer seemed to have so many problems.For the chips alone it is worth every penny.They really are crispy and if you buy skinny frozen chips they taste exactly like McDonald chips.Uncooked frozen snacks like sausage rolls,samosa's(the frozen Indian variety that normally need to be deep fried) are just amazing.I was less impressed with steak and  pork chops which I usually grill and will probaly continue to do so.<br>The biggest problem is that as it is such a new way of cooking you have to experiment a lot.The second problem is that the portion sizes that can be cooked are quite small.<br>I am going to try drumsticks,fish cakes and homemade wedges next.This is a very easy product to clean and am looking to use it to cook  starters at my next dinner party, much better than messing around with frying pans when you are entertaining.All in all I am well pleased with the product but to get the most out of it you do need to experiment a bit and expect a few disasters on the way."
"Perfect for roast potatoes and gorgeous low fat chips!<br>The best part is...hardly any oil is required to get<br>good results every time!( also does frozen chips)"
"I must say that when I bought the airFryer I wasn't sure that it was a good buy. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and simplicity of the product. It is durable and looks nice. The biggest turn on was that the food tasted great, it is easy to use and clean and IT ID HEALTHY. I would highly recommend it."
"Philips Airfryer Instructions tell you to cook frozen chips and cut up potatoes direct from the freezer. THIS IS WRONG.<br>I was doing this, but after a few disappointments, I realized that straight from the freezer the food was full of moisture and that prevents crisping. So now I leave the food to come up to ambient temperature,  you will see how much liquid comes out,  then put them in the Airfryer and they come out nicely cooked and CRISPY.<br>Clearly the manufacturers have written their instructions from a SELLING POINT OF VIEW not a practical viewpoint."
"We have not used this in anger yet, having only cooked chips and potatoes so far, but it works really well, is easy to clean and produces good results."
"Total value for money. 2 of our freinds have also bought one after chatting about this at work. No more lingering fat smells after cooking chips. Also the Health benefits from using this are great in comparison to the old ways of frying food. You wont be disapointed."
"Although i cannot deny this air fryer is healthier for me, it basically a chip pan, i've tried cooking other stuff like chicken and fish which are ok but look anemic. However it does cook the chips fairly well and they are crispier.  have even done the slimming world chips in the airfryer and they turned out better than i ever did them in the oven"
"We were a bit dubious about some of the claims about how good this product was, but we can only say that it has met all of our expectations.  it cooks chips exactly how we like them.  We have also cooked chips/sliced potatoes without using any oil, just par cook them beforehand and finish off in the fryer for 12 minutes, wonderful!!"
"I read all the hype reviews on this product and decided to buy..........big mistake, one of the worst products I have ever seen.<br>The only half decent chips it made were from frozen oven chips which kind of defeats the object.<br>I tried all the recommendations for different chip Recipes, all failures, don't buy."
"Great little machine,I didn't know it was possible to fry with steam my wings turned out crisper than frying in a pan with no messy oil."
"This has been a great success for me,  I use it a lot.  It's faster than conventional cooking and very convenient to use.  I like the timer which turns it off after the prescribed time. I don't find it quite so good for chips as it might be.  If you only wanted to cook chips in it I prefer the Tefal Actifry, but I really recommend it for all other foods.  I cook \"fried\" bread in it, chops, sausages, Kievs, pies and so on,  I have cooked eggs in a pyrex dish.  I am going to try Yorkshire pudding soon and really expect that to work well.  I wouldn't be without mine and use it nearly every day, often for two or three items."
"was sceptical about this product but no need it is versatile easy to clean makes the best guiltfree chips fantastic"
"I AM QUITE PLEASED WITH THIS APPLIANCE AS IT MAKES LOVELY CHIPS AND ROAST POTATOES ALSO DOES CHOPS NICELY ALTHOUGH HAVE TO KEEP MY EYE ON THEM AS THEY COOK VERY QUICKLY , BUT WILL GET USED TO TIMING THEM WITH USE.<br>THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS cleaning THE WIRE PAN AS IFIND BITS STICK IN THE MESH AND ARE DIFFICULT TO GET OUT."
"I've waited quite a while to write this review to see if I stopped using it - I'm a bit of a gadget freak and my garage is full of things I've thought were going to be great and then after a while I've tired of them and they've ended up unloved and unused - this machine I use every day.  I've found I cook everything in it - it's really good to roll up bacon and stand it on it side and it cooks really quickly and crispy in a couple of minutes for bacon sandwiches - we put microwave meals in it, like macaroni cheese and it comes out with a lovely crispy top and cooked all the way through - wrap chicken breast in palma ham with a sprig of herbs, home made pain au chocolate - all crispy on the outside and soft melted chocolate in the middle.  The only issue with it are getting the basket in and out - you need to watch out as the release button pulls the basket up and drops the base (which will crack and I've had to replace it once) - so make sure the base is standing on something when you do this and it does take up a lot of room in the dishwasher.  On the other hand it's there, ready to use, heats up in minutes, cooks everything crispy and fast and the timer which switches it off makes it easy for the kids to use.  Love it :D"
"Wow this fryer works wonders, I could not get my head around the fact that they would be crispy with out all the oil BUT I love the chips and there super hot cant wait to try other food in it YUM"
"First let me start by recommending this Air Fryer. If I have the option, I would give it four and half stars. So far I have no regrets buying it.<br>The negatives (if you can call them that)are:<br>-It is a bit noisy particularly if you are working in an open plan kitchen<br>-It is not totally odder free, you certainly can smell the chips frying inside<br>-It can be a bit small for the larger family<br><br>The positives:<br>-Well Made<br>-Compact Design<br>-Fast in comparison with other method of cooking<br>-Chips are as great as they can be without the oil (I used morris piper and it tested great)<br>-suitable for all sort of meet cuts and other type of food. I personally tried it with chicken wings and other cuts and was very impressed<br>-Relatively easy to clean<br>-All the other advertised benefits, healthy, cheap to run, etc."
"I was very undecided between air fryer & actifryer but decided to go with Phillips due to the 60 day money back guarantee. I won't be needing it as I absolutely love the air fryer! I have used it every day since I bought it & my old oil fryer has been packed away. I would recommend buying the baking tin as some food sticks to the basket."
"I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS AIR FRYER.  SO EASY TO CLEAN .COOK ALL SORTS IN IT.  ALSO A SMALL CHICKEN COOKED PERFECT. HIGHLY RECOMEND  THIS.MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTIFRY I HAD."
"Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this purchase.  It didn't do what it said and although I followed the instructions to the last word my chips were never crispy.  I never got to try any other food items as I mainly bought it for chips.<br>However, it is a very nice looking piece of equipment."
"Certainly does what it says on the tin.  We had never had an air fryer before. We were impressed by other reviews so we gave it a try.  I'm a real chip fan.  We have had it for almost 14 months now and get super results every time.  One of the best gagets I've bought and I'm into gagets.<br><br>Far better than oven chips and almost as good as real french frys but less fat.<br><br>We had a few dissapointments in the early days such as not cooked evenly and funny taste. Discovered this was due to using wrong oil, wrong type or not fresh potatoes.<br><br>We have learnt that it is important to; use an oil that can withstand high temperature so that taste is not affected, we use ground nut oil. select potatoes that are best suited to chips. use fresh potatoes. cut chips uniformly, we use a potato chipper and I prefer small almost french frys size. soak the chips in water for 20 mins changing the water a couple of times, dry them thogoughly before applying the oil. put chips into a bowl sprinkle on the oil and shake them round in the bowl till they are all evenly coated. tip the chips out into the bowl you used to apply the oil a couple of times during the cooking process, gives a more even cooking effect. Thoroughly clean the chip pan and container after each use.<br><br>We have found it best to cook for longer at 170 C rather than shorter time at 200 C.  Too high a temperature will burn on the outside but not necessarily cooked through."
"This is a very simple product to use. Only two controls, one of temperature and the other the timer. My reason for getting it was chips. Normal fryers have the problems of oil, with all the problems that comes with it. By using the Philips Airfryer you have no oil to dispose of and a greatly reduced fire risk. I imagine that it could be possible to ignite it but it would take a lot of effort, as it only has a thirty minute timer. So you can have much healthier chips and without the smell.<br><br>The fryer comes with a quick start guide; 30 quick recipes in a trilingual (English French and Dutch) format; and a Getting Started card with settings for various chip sizes. So you should be able to have some chips cooked in no time. The only thing that you need to do is make sure that you have enough chips to cook. When set up the Airfryer is quite tall 33cm and probably too tall to put in a cupboard.<br><br>As to using it. It is very simple to use. Once you put the food into the tray and set the temperature just turn it on by setting the timer to the time required. When running it makes a bit of noise but tolerable. Once the timer has run its course there is a bell to tell you that it is finished. You can then pour out your chips. It is not just a simple fryer. So if you can think outside the box it can be used like a mini oven or grill.  One of the first things that I tried cooking was a cauliflower cheese. I found a pyrex bowl that was small enough to fit into the fryer tray and then prepared the cauliflower and as it was already cooked the addition of cheese and sauce finished it off. Twenty minutes in the fryer was all that it needed. Lovely crisp cheese topping made it perfect. There is even a recipe for ring doughnuts, which I must try one day.<br><br>If you love oven chips or onion rings then this is perfect. It means you can produce chips so quickly, in twenty minutes or less and it probably is cheaper to run than a full sized oven, as the hot air circulates within the oven and with the odd shake allows you to cook them evenly and with less hot air lost when you open it to check."
"We bought this hot air fryer because it seemed to be more versatile than the Tefal Actifry but we were very disappointed with its performance. We do not eat chips as a habit but we tried several times, using Maris Piper potatoes, following the instructions to the letter and also experimenting a bit. The chips were never anything like we expected from the advertising. On the plus side, it will cook chicken and other non-chip things such as frozen crumbed fish etc.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/276-9638689-5637336\">Philips AirFryer Healthier Oil-Free Fryer</a>"
"We were fed up with oven chips, but didn't want to go to the unhealthy option of a deep fat fryer. I stumbled upon this by accident and can't rate it highly enough. So far we have only really used it for chips and variations of roast potatoes, but we are all really impressed with them. I only use such a small amount of oil and a sprinkling of salt and the result is perfect tasting chips, and in one basket we can cook enough for four adult portions. Looking forward to trying lots of other things in it."
"I use the Philips AirFryer every day and have experimented extensively. It's definitely NOT just for chips !! I have made yorkshire puddings and I cooked a pork loin, which my dinner guests said was the most succulent they had ever tasted. I finish off the part-baked bread rolls that are widely available in the supemarket, for a warm and tasty addition to any meal, but especially breakfast. I also find that air-fried 'roast' carrots are to die for.<br>The Cleaning of the appliance is quick and easy - and I would recomend the Philips AirFryer wholeheartedly."
"Brilliant product, quick clean and easy to use.. haven't experimented much yet, but will do so soon. Prefer to cook oven chips in it.. no oil needed, quicker than from potatoes and taste really good.. Extremely pleased with this purchase. Bought it on recommendation and have recommended it to all my friends."
"I was surprised at the size of the machine, but the only down side I felt was that you had to keep shaking whatever you were cooking where as with the Tefal Actifry this is done for you with a paddle that rotates as it cooks.<br><br>But if you are cooking something that is more fragile than potatoes this machine is better as you can turn it yourself.<br><br>All in all quite a good machine."
"This item could not be more convenient to to use.  Delicious chips, wedges, roast new potatoes, etc. in very little time, with no offensive smell.  Simple to use, easy to clean.  The video review elsewhere convinced me to buy and I have not had the sticky drawer problem that reported.  The worktop footprint is fully justified.  Great chicken wings, too!"
"After reading reviews of Philips Airfryer and many other competitors available in market, I finally decided to go with this as I trust PHILIPS more than any company in the market. And when I finally got the fryer 2 months ago, I learnt alot of things whilst operating it... Its easy to find out recipes from internet and cook them accordingly in the airfryer... Now, regularly I cook fries (frozen and fresh), jack potatoes, wedges, grilled veggies and sometimes, I heat other fried items which are left overs and had to be kept in oven to come back to original crisp ones... This fryer is like a life saving appliance and I have several reasons to tell this... I don't put oil for cooking of foods, means I eat low cholesterol food with minimum or no oil. This leads to healthy and fat free diet... And most importantly, it takes less place to operate and Cleaning is very easy and kind of compact and not at all noisy... I love this appliance... You should definitely think to purchase, If you are not interested in spending money for buying expensive ovens or if they are not supplied in your house like student accommodations..."
"Had it a year or so now. Still love it. Live alone and seldom need to use the oven. I can do most things in the fryer. Quick to heat up. Quick to cook healthy food. I love parsnip chips. Roasted veggies. Fish, chicken, sausages, all sorts. Ideal for heating pies etc. Washing up and especially Cleaning the machine itself rather fiddly. I've dropped the handle bit and the plastic which forms part of the housing has cracked, doesn't look so swish now. Should check if I can replace it. But in that it's regularly washed up it's bound to fall off the draining board again! If they revamp it hopefully it will be stronger less brittle and easier to clean. I bought it on offer and can't imagine how I ever lived without it."
"I initially found the chips (frozen) were somewhat dry compared to cooking in oil. On my third attempt using slightly thicker chips I found an improvement. I think it might be better to add oil to the pan - say a tablespoon of oil !!!<br>I also found it to be a very easy piece of kitchen equipment to use and very easy to clean."
"This is a little gem. Fries anything a chip pan will. Not suitable to a family unless you dont want much or you are prepared to fry more than once."
"Bought for family in an attempt to have healthy chips!<br>I love it. the chips it can make are delicious and it also does other things too.<br>It replaced my deep fat fryer and now i dont get greasy steam clouds!<br>You switch it on and it pings when cooked, much like a microwave. I dont feel i have to stand over it in case of a fat fire (as seen on all fire shows) as it used little or no fat!"
"To get the best chips is easy . Buy a large plastic bowl cut your chips up half hour before cooking place chips in bowl put teaspoon of oil in bowl mix both together leave for half hour and then preheat Philips then cook they are just like my mum made but without the fat best thing I've ever brought font forget to toss chips whilst cooking ."
"chips are not golden and crispy they are soggy and unevenly cooked may just have well have popped them in the oven and yes i did shake them around frequently"
"I bought this Phillips air Frier, because I decided it was time to be a little bit more Health concious,i'm very pleased with the results,my chips are nice and crispy on the outside,nice and fluffy on the inside.roast potato' are great as well.<br>  I  would recommend this with no hesitation."
"not quite sure yet, must find more things to do with it, have done oven chips ( not a big lover of them ) passable have warmed bread rolles good put a crispy top on 2 day old rolls. will keep trying though. yours chris cross."
"Was unsure about this initially but soon came round! Food is tasty and not oily! Easy to keep clean too!"
"It does what it says but it is limited according to literature. However I think you can do lots more with a little creativity for example, using the empty pie tine (Fray Bentos) can do sausages and roast tatties. Will do more"
"Very pleased with this dry fryer.Only have a small kitchen and this doesn't take up too much room .Only 2 of us and it holds plenty of chips,roasters etc.Also cooks stuffed peppers to perfection and frozen sausage rolls turn out great. I like the fact you only use a small amount of fat.One of my better buys."
"I think everybody loves chips, (well almost everyone) which this appliance does, without or just a spray of oil and cooks them well. But not just chips, chicken, pork, quiches, jacket potatoes, and these are just a few things I have cooked, the taste stays in the food and is faster than a normal oven."
"This is simply the best kitchen gadget we have bought so far after the panasonic breadmaker. The integrated filter within the fryer is excellent for taking out the smell that exudes while frying food. There is very little or no oil involved in the frying process. Also the basket and its holder is very easy to clean. Our main oven has since gone into hibernation mode. More fun with little or no mess. A must have for every kitchen. This is better than its competitor since it does not have any moving parts and occupies less space on the worktop."
"Love this product, have been thinking about buying a healthy oil-free fryer for a while. Had heard of Toshiba Airfryer but put off by reviews, especially Safety problems. Had not heard of this product before, saw this on Amazon Black Friday offers and liked the reviews. Have had it for about a month and use it several times a week, am really pleased with it, cooks delicious chips and is easy to use"
"Bought this to replace 4th broken Tefal Actifry at a friends recommendation can't believe how much quieter, easier to clean & better it cooks, quicker too and it has 2 year warranty - obviously Philips are more confident in their product than Tefal are & I believe it will last longer as there are no moving parts. I use an airfryer to aid my weight loss plan and have successfully lost over 8st - Couldn't be happier with the product."
"yes would recommend,does great chips. roast potatoes, etc better by far than other<br>fryer's used, no greasy mess,brilliant well pleased."
"My dear wife had several expensive items on her Xmas list, the top one being a puppy. So did I think that an AirFryer would be well received?? I bought it anyway because despite the promises she made, it would be me who eventually did the daily walks. I reasoned that the healthier diet options from low fat cooking would do my aging body more good than tramping around the fields in the cold and wet twice a day. About a year ago, seduced by the TV advert, my wife bought a Tefal Actifry which worked for all of 3 weeks. When I read the reviews and discovered numerous others had had equal unreliability issues, good old Amazon gave me a full refund. Not wanting to suffer the same experience with another new \"low fat\" gizmo, I spent time thoroughly researching performance from users and professional reviewers. As you will see from the many reviewers here already, its a great product that does what it claims. There's little to go wrong because its basically just a nicely styled fan oven that sits on a worktop and looks like a bread maker.  The  chips and cubes are really crispy and brown by just following the simple instructions. It's so easy to use and the two part pan/sieve is dishwasher friendly. Despite the disappointment regarding the puppy (I did get something  else on her wish list) this new toy has been well received and used many time already."
"The reason I recomonded because it is easy, simple, and good price. It is a Health choice for you and your family."
"I really like the air fryer it does what it says on the box my family say frozen chips the best"
"So far all I've cooked with this are homemade chips and the results have been satisfactory. The chips were not quite as crispy as ones I made in a deep fat fryer but were still very nice and obviously quite a bit healthier. The fryer is slightly larger than the deep fat fryer we had and a lot noisier but on the plus side does not have the nasty smell of oil wafting around the room after use. It is also took pretty close to the same time to cook the chips compared to the deep fat fryer, maybe slightly longer, but certainly a lot faster than cooking them in the oven, which we did when looking for a healthier option before.<br>So in summary we're pretty satisfied with it but I suppose I was expecting a bit more. For example you can't cook anything wet in it as you can in a deep fat fryer (like say homemade battered fish) but then it is supposed to encourage healthier options! :)"
"THIS IS OK NOT WORTH SO MUCH MONEY THOUGH.<br>HAVE TO WATCH THAT IT SMOKES A LOT AND IS noisy"
"A COMPACT ELECTRIC AIR CIRCULATED OVEN, DOES WORK WELL, COOKS CHICKEN, BEEF, CHIPS, PATOTES, HANDY DEVICE IN THE KITCHEN, DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BAD POINT IS A LOT OF SMOKE FROM THE REAR PASSES OUT. NEED AN EXTRACT IN THE KITCHEN TO KEEP AIR LEVELS NORMAL.<br>YES I AGREE TOO expensive, I ONLY PAID £59.00 NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT FULL RETAIL price HENCE ONLY 2 STARS."
"First very pleased with the prompt delivery of this item it was securely packed, the airfryer is just as described and I bought this item as there were so many good reviews for it. I have t experiment more with it, but I have cooked chips homemade and from frozen and it is so quick, also I have cooked fish fingers together with the chips, saves putting the oven on and waiting for it to warm up.<br>The very good aspect of this product is  that it is so easy to clean, they say you can put the base and net basket in the dishwasher, but there is no need as it just takes a few minutes to wash in hot soapy water. I would say I wish there was a more comprehensive cookbook with it, so I will just experiment myself. but overall a very good product."
"My previous deep fat fryer broke down so I decided to go for this oil-free option and have been pleased with my decision.  I have so far only used frozen chips and have  experimented with and without oil.  The preference so far has been to use a desertspoon of sunflower oil and cook for 6 minutes,  remove from fryer shake and then cook for a further 6 minutes. This has been satisfactory.  I intend to try from fresh potatoes but haven't done so so far.  I  am much happier with this oil-free option - not only from the  health aspect but  this is  much safer to have in the home.  The chips are different from those cooked in deep fat  oil but very nice - don't feel you want so  many, which is a good thing.  I am pleased with the fryer."
"Good product makes great chips, wedges etc.<br><br>I have cooked fish and meat in this it is so simple to get good results"
"never mind the chips try the chops and the chicken, never better. Will keep you up dated not had it long"
"Very pleased with my purchase. It was a bit larger than I expected but it works so very well of all food items I have tried so far."
"This machine is very noisy and takes up a lot of space but makes good chips from scratch and OK from frozen but probably needs less time than advised if frozen. easy to use and fairly sturdy. We like it and its chips. I haven't tried anything else from the cookery book yet."
"I bought this as a present for my partner. Best purchase in a long while. Chips are fantastic. Great if you are single and or a couple as it is quick and easy to use. Is there a family size one?"
"Very easy to useand produces hearty, healthy fries! I usespray oil to coat the fries and they have turned out perfectly each time."
"I always wanted one of these and came by it almost accidentally (another story).  Fortunately I have a lot of work space, otherwise I think it would dominate a small kitchen. Does what it says on the box.  Great."
"This fryer does exactly what it sets out to do - fries without the need to immerse food in oil in a deep fat fryer.  However, does it do better than a fan-assisted oven?  I'm not sure, and do not consider it Value for money, except maybe for people who really need to avoid fatty food.  Personally I far prefer the taste and texture of deep-fried food."
"This product is the best we have found it is well made and looks good on the worktop after we have got use to it cooks oven chips without any oil very happy"
"I bought this when I sold my completely unused deep fat fryer as I couldn't stand the hassle of getting it out and for healthy reasons had switched to oven chips, etc. My skinny other half though wasn't a fan as he said they \"weren't quite the same as real chips\". Enter the Air Fryer - Wow - the first chips we did were the very same oven \"less than 5% fat\" chips. Not only did they cook faster - 15 minutes (from cold) rather than 20/ 22 minutes in my fan assisted oven I was also not heating up an entire family sized oven for a tray of chips. Shaking every 5  minutes wasn't a problem. The smell was of \"proper\" chips but not as overpowering as deep frying and the chips were gorgeous. It is true they are not the same as those from a shop but they are significantly better than done in the traditional oven. Since then we have done scampi and are itching to try wedges - sweet potato or ordinary. The scampi I did together with the chips - put the chips in first then added the scampi to the same basket. Very handy. We are a family of 3 and it will hold enough for a lunch of chips and something but over that I can see a need to do in two batches. What I am looking forward to is a few chips with a salad in summer or the garlic prawns.<br>The book that comes with it is good but I did also buy the two books that will appear in your recommendations. They are ok - the main value is ideas for other items. For example I can't wait to do bacon - will save a huge grill pan wash! cleaning is very easy. The pan comes fully out and the basket comes out of that. Both are diswasher safe which I have done. However as breaded food can stick to the basket I now hand wash - but it is non-stick so no metal utensils or scourer."
"I chose this rating as it does not do the job for which it was intended.  The chips come out only half brown and I have now given up and gone back to ordinary frying in a chip pan.  I am sorry that I relied on TV adverts which show the chips come out all nicely brown and crisp.<br>I only now use it for warming up like a bread roll.  Just pop it in the give it a couple of mins.<br>Waste of money."
"too much messing about with this machine,it may have less parts to go wrong,my actifry made better chips but the paddle and handle broke after 12 months which was a shame,with the philips you have to shake the pan every 5 minutes and it takes 45 mins to brown the chips, you have to cover every chip with oil or they fry blotchy, only used the machine twice since it arrived this week and not impressed,will give it a couple weeks but if no improvement its going on the car boot sale,"
"Got it for 2 months now, and honestly didn't buy cooking oil since then. Chips, fish, chicken, nugget, burger, all in there now. Fast and very convenience, and no more big oven to cook little food, no more fried with oil, no more microwave.<br><br>Pro : healthy cook, fast, energy saving<br>Cons : bulky for only 800ml max cooking compartment<br>Tips : easy to wash it when it still hot, with warm water."
"I am pleased with this product the only drawback is the price for £106. I know that they were nearly £200 a while ago and I certainly would not pay that much. However the fryer works well and does make a good chip after experimenting. It also has many other culinary uses, so I do use it rather a lot. It also looks OK. and fits nicely in a small kitchen."
"Was a present for my parents. Didn't expect the unit to be so large and the cooking compartment to be so small!<br><br>However...There was no food separator in the box. Spoke to Amazon, hoping and they send out just the missing part -but no, they sent a whole new unit out to me. So I had to go through the inconvenience of sending the original unit back.<br>The replacement unit also didn't have a food separator!<br>Asked for a refund.<br>."
"this fryer arrived today without the seperater that seperates the food in the basket, i have already done away with the box it came in, so i cant return it, [ my own fault] so im left here with a imcomplete fryer  this is my second  bad experience with amazon in the past couple of months, i also received a fawlty phone from them just a couple of months ago. i have learned my lesson, never again will i buy from this mickey mouse site again,"
"Bought this product as a gift for a friend. She liked it after using at my place and went gaga over it.<br>Few days after she received it as a surprise gift from me and threw a party in its honer.<br>Now she never fries her food.<br>It's amazing product."
"Very happy with the purchase. No more deep fry. No smell  and quick nuggets n fries for the kids. The fryer is a bit big but you needed the size anyhow to fry stuff for a family."
"This is the best product I have ever bought had the tefal actifry before this model and the taste of the chips are great the fryer is easy to .use and easier to clean would definately recommend this to all my friends and family easy to store as well"
"Unless you're feeding huge numbers, this could do a lot of the work you get your oven to do, without burning 10p to preheat the cavity.<br><br>It's a bit pokey if you're into batch baking but for everyday things - and I'd rather not mention ovenchips - this countertop hot air oven will cut 25% off most cooking times - and, it follows, your electricity bill.<br><br>Forget baking off with Mel'n'Sue, just pour yourself a drink, tip the bag into the basket. Turn the dial and pretty soon you'll be eating.<br><br>You can cook fresh foods in it, too. They tell me."
"I bought this cos i thought i would go for the healthy option of no oil.<br>The fryer is well made and looks good. I used it for making a plate of chips. For this I used oven chips and cos i hadnt used it before i set the timer to 25mins.After 15 mins i thought they might need shaking so i pulled them out.They were actually fully cooked and didnt need shaking.I would imagine that if you had a full basket you would have to shake them after say 10 mins.<br>I was pleased with the result,the chips taste like oven chips and not like \"chip shop chips\" due to no oil.<br>Overall i would recomend this product and look forward to trying out other stuff in it."
"Really pleased with hot air fryer, variable heat control is excellent idea , crispy chips in no time and not covered in oil as this drops through mesh into tray below. Better than certain other fryer we had that had a moving part that snapped !<br>Ordered item on a Tuesday and it arrived Friday and as I live in channel isles I was really impressed!!!  Also looks smart sitting on work top and easy to clean!"
"I am very pleased with the product.  A bit of trial and error in the beginning to get the chips just right but have got the hang of it now.  It is time saving and money saving.  Great if you need a quick meal i.e., chicken nuggets and chips as can cook both at the same time.  Excellent am very pleased with this."
"Decided to buy this product for two reasons, My original oil fryer was cheap and suffered from leaking. So I looked up fryers on the internet and came across this little thing.<br><br>After consulting the reviews and the price compared to other retailers I decided to go through and purchase. And I tell you, it was one of the best online shopping purchases ever!<br><br>Liked:<br>Quicker than average oil based fryer<br>Food somehow tastes nicer<br><br>Disliked<br>Only thing I could think of would be the lack of food seperator  included with the product. But this does not affect its performance and thus keeps its 5 star rating!<br><br>I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family, infact I have already done so. As my mother has constantly asked me about where to find this product and how to use it!"
"Fantastic product. I looked in to the many and varied airfrying products and this came out the best. I bided my time and got it for under £100. I checked out other customer reviews and tips. I have found it to be neat and an ok size to be on the work top,the chips taste great (though will probably never beat deep fat frying),roast potatoes are great too-I part boil them in the same way I would have for oven roasting. I like the fact I have to shake the basket every 5-10 mins as it feels like I'm actually part of the cooking process and the chips are cooked how I want them to be as apposed to the machine turning them.  My old chip pan went straight in the bin with no regrets."
"I didn't realise that the product I chose did not have the separator in it or the baking tray and this limits the usefulness of the product for me.  on reflection I would have preferred the Tefal Airfryer."
"This has changed our lives. The AirFryer has allowed us to cut back on oils massively. I know that you can add a spoon of oil if you want it but really it is not needed. The drawer is big enough for 3 people (4 if you dont eat much) and all the fat that comes out of the food is kept in the bottom for easy Cleaning. The airflow is in the back so you will need to put it in a open area to prevent overheating or fat concentration on cupboards."
"I really like this fryer. So far I have cooked frozen and fresh chips, frozen roasted vegatables and frozen honey coated parsnips. They all turned out beautifully. (I usually burn the roasted veg and parsnips in the oven) So I am well pleased, no more burnt offerings.<br>It also looks very stylish on the side and is really easy to clean.<br>I only have one problem with it and that is if you try to fry too many chips at once they don't cook very evenly. But as I usually only cook single portions of frozen chips and fresh ones  thats not to much of a problem"
"I have had this fryer for 6 months now and it is really easy to use and the food tastes really nice. I have never owned a fryer before and bought this because of it's healthy cooking. Thoroughly recommended."
"Early days yet but have used it a couple of time to do chips.  Chips come out perfect and it is great that one can time the cooking.<br> No messy oil and no boiling up so a very safe, ideal for hungry teenagers coming in late at night, no risk of fire.<br>The appliance is rather unattractive and bulky, my own fault for not checking the specifations, and would not have it sitting on the worktop.<br>Inspite of the above I would recommend it to others and I can't wait to try out the Recipes."
"i've tried other oil-free fryer's luckily was able to send them back , this one is good for 2 reasons the price  & the fryer is great not had home cooked chips for sevsral years because of the fat but now what is a squirt of oil between friends this fryer is big enough for 2 people do try it."
"I purchased this AirFryer after previously having the actifry ,after a year the paddle broke and the little mesh that protects the fan had cracked too so I thought I would look around for an alternative .<br>I absolutely,its great for chips with very little oil and I also use fry light to spray them ,even less oil .Some people  complain about having to turn the chips or give them a shake but this does not bother me because if I am cooking anyway I am in the kitchen so its no trouble .I have cooked things liek chicken nuggets for the boys and also veggie burgers and warmed up chicken legs and it does a great job ,so far I am really happy with it and it looks stylish too :)"
"Cooks lovely chips better than in the oven. I bang my frozen puds in for 4 min they come out crispy and perfect. You can cook almost anything in it. Garlic mushrooms, chocolate brownies. I find the airfryer very handy."
"I am pleased with this Air Fryer. The chipoholic of our family is happy with the Quality of the chips it produces. I haven't tried cooking anything else in it. The reason I purchased it was mainly to reduce fat intake. I think it has done that.<br>It is rather large so stays out on the work top.<br>It is very easily cleaned. It is basically a mini fan oven, that works well."
"Fast clean cooking,great for some food in small amounts so quick,use it most day and so easy to clean ,buy it."
"This works, although at the moment I have only used it for making chips. They can't taste exactly the same, but are an excellent compromise. My only complaint is that the basket is quite small and to make crispy chips you have to finish the cooking in batches. Very time consuming. However this is a great tool for those wanting a healthier lifestyle."
"Lovely for scampi and chips, no smell or greasiness, lovely and crispy every time. Easy to clean. very neat and tidy."
"brilliant oven chips cook just perfect in 15 mins no mess same for goujons  would recommend  also so easy to clean"
"Bought this because fed up with tasteless oven chips and smell of fat after cooking normal chips. This cooks chips which are soft and browned, they are the nicest tasting chips we have had. Not yet tried it for cooking other items but will get round to it. Due to the tiny amount of oil the chips are also very healthy. Would recomend to anyone who likes chips but is also Health conscious."
"I love this heater and use it regularly. Cooks food well and evenly in my experience but there are a couple of drawbacks.<br>1. Difficult to master and to cook real chips. Frozen ones cook well though.<br>2. When you clean it out then use it again it does give off some smoke/smell.<br>Overall I'm happy with this product though."
"this is by far the best\" fryer\" I have owned, I have cooked many different thing in it and the results are always good  would highly recommend  this item"
"A very nice product,.prompt delivery,..well made quality article..I would recommend this lovely article to family and friends..Thank you very much!"
"I'm definitely not a fan of oven chips cooked in the oven,  but have found conventional deep fat fryers messy to use & clean. So I decided to give this innovative 'fryer' a try. I cooked oven chips in it (enough for 3 people),  together with a few chicken nuggets - both from frozen without Pre-heating. I set the temperature at 200° & the timer for 20 minutes,  then it was a case of just leaving it to cook. Half way through I removed the basket to give everything a shake as recommended - make sure it's on a heat proof surface as it continues to run when the basket is removed.<br>The results were pretty amazing - they are the best oven chips I've ever had; not over dry,  but lovely & crisp all the way round. The chicken nuggets were beautifully cooked & crispy too.<br>My only warning is that reading the FAQs suggests that the fryer comes with a divider for the basket,  to separate foods being cooked together. This model does not have the divider or the baking tray - there is another model which has these features.<br>Anyway,  I bought it primarily for cooking chips & it has certainly fulfilled that requirement. I don't think it's worth £200,  but at £89 it's definitely worth it."
"I dont normally do reviews but on this product I just had to.  I got this at half price so a bargain!!.  We have used it every day since we have had it.  Chicken nuggets for the kids are great, chips (frozen ones)are so crispy and fluffy inside. Onion rings are lovely. Chicken Breast coated in your favourite coating is so easy!. The best thing we find with this is the kids can use it.  It like a microwave to them.  If the lad wants a fishfinger sandwich then he just chucks them in a turns it on and waits for the ding!  At least we know now he wont be messing with the gas oven which obviously is a lot more dangerous and probably more expensive to run!.<br><br>when finished put the stuff in dishwasher<br><br>A great product!  Get one now"
"HOWEVER!<br><br>I thought there was supposed to be a food seperator with this but I just cannot figure it out! I think this particular model should have one but its not there and I can't see it in the product description either! Philips certainly know how to confuse you!<br>And if I'm wrong, where do I buy this extra bit from!!!"
"Really pleased so far. I add garlic salt and dried herbs to potatoes and they taste delicious. Good for fish fingers/nuggets too."
"I love it. I suggest it to everyone: cheap, healthy, design appealing. Chips are perfect. I use it also for burgers and it's just perfect."
"My husband had been badgering me for months to get one of these (men liking all things starch and fried) so in the end i gave in and ordered it. It arrived a little before the due date in pristine condition. It is a nice looking gadget i.e. i don't feel the need to hide it in a cupboard or the utility room, and it matches our black shiny fridge. We've used it about a dozen times now and my husband is addicted. As others have said, lots of shaking during the cooking cycle helps to keep the chips evenly cooked. The taste is very good i.e. real potato rather than coated reconstituted oven chips. cleaning is easy now we've sussed it - originally we left it from cook to cook and ended up with stuck on goo which was horrid. Now i give it a detergent wash and wipe afetr every use and it's a doddle - nothing sticks to it and it still looks good. A good buy!"
"This product is fabulous, cooks homemade and frozen chips great, no mess, no small and not a lot of Cleaning to do. It also cooks in a much healthier way"
"Perfect"
"Fantastic product - only missing food separator which should have been included even though a sealed box and why you have to buy a separate basket at the cost of this product is unreal.<br>Good product  - a little more customer care would be better as attitude certainly appears as 'no problem' as long as you continue to throw money at us otherwise go away"
"Fantastic product.<br><br>Especially great if you're using pre-fried items like oven chips or spring rolls etc.<br><br>Where they are really good is making your own fries, your own fried chicken, and or even baking a cake!  All with using next to no fat at all!<br><br>Tip: Must put some water in the bottom of the tray, or you'll end up with loads of smoke....the same way you would if you didn't put some liquid in the bottom of your oven trays when cooking at high temperatures!"
"I received the item a day EARLIER than was told but I had a feeling this would happen as I was able to track the item as it made its way across the country, Top marks for that. so Far so good.<br>When I got it out of the packaging, I placed it on my kitchen worktop, I got the black one and it was so shiny,( like Darth Vaders helmet ). I thought it looked wonderful.<br>I read the instruction booklet for first use info. It looked so easy to use and is !<br>I tried it that night and cooked some oven chips... NO OIL ! they tasted fantastic (Shake half way through)  and better than in the oven, I didn't seem to get the charring of the small chips, or was minimalised. No fat to clean or change in a few weeks like with a deep fat fryer. Quick too. Including the 3 min warm up period it recommends, 11 mins to cook my chips. plenty of time to prepare other ingredients.<br>When I looked in the unit after I had cooked my food, I thought I hadn't used it. It was nearly spotless.<br>Any Down sides?........ One.<br>I the instruction manual said that a separator plate can be used in the frying basket to cook 2 different food types at the same time but it wasn't there. Nor was a bowl that sits around the basket for cooking other types of food although the manual did say this bowl was for a different model.<br>The plate was a pain though but AMAZON CAME THROUGH, they checked another box on their shelf and reported the plate was there. Apparently Philips say from 2011 they only supply this plate to Australia and Korea ? The other box must have been there awhile.<br>They refunded me the £11 it would cost to buy one from Philips.<br>There are Youtube videos on using this item, the ones I saw were done by an Australian presenter and she was using the separator plate and bowl, which for some reason I can't fathom, Philips are happy to supply them with but not Europe.<br>I can imagine the meeting at Philips, Top executives sitting around a big table pontificating about the Europeans not being trusted with this tiny separator plate. Unfortunately I couldn't quite hear the reasons because the noise the other Hoorah Henrys were making at the table.<br><br>Way to go Philips !<br><br>Ruin a fantastic product"
"This product does what it says on the tin so to speak. Whilst it takes up quite a bit of room in the kitchen it makes really good chips both from frozen to fresh hand cut ones. Still experimenting with other Recipes but nothing so far has been disappointing."
"I am really pleased with this item, it has cooked perfect chips I no longer need to buy frozen packs of oven chips.<br>It also makes perfect roast vegetables, I have still to cook spicy wedges but I do not see a problem the instructions are clear enough.<br>Delivery was excellent, delivered ahead of the advised delivery date."
"What a fabulous product. Frozen chips have never tasted this good before we had the Airfryer. The only reason I would still put chips in the oven is if it were going to be on anyway. Jacket potatoes are brilliant, lovely crisp skins and so soft in the middle. Only thing I would say,start the jackets off in the microwave for a few minutes then transfer to the Air fryer, we found they took an awfully long time to cook solely in the Airfryer. Pasties and Battered Onions heat up and are lovely and crispy. So keeps our cholesterol down. In fact hubby's cholesterol was down to 4.2 recently. Obviously I cannot say it was down to the Airfryer but it certainly helps. We don't find it noisy like others have commented. We do shake the chips frequently to make them cook evenly but not a problem. For a healthier way of eating chips  you cannot better it. The airfryer looks good too and we haven't noticed finger marks as I thought we might being shiny black. I was hoping to buy the matt black one that has digital controls but even though it is advertised in Argos and Homebase it isn't actually available in the UK until Autumn which is a bit misleading. Definitely worth the money."
"Have only used the fryer to cook chips, the results were tasty.  However, extremely disappointed to find that after only two uses the coating on the base of the pan holding the basket has started to come off.  It has been even more disapponting to have found no way of contacting anyone at Amazon by telephone to advise them of the poor Quality of this item.  The returns system appears to be geared to returning items not used but no longer required not for items that fail after use."
"the recipe guides before you buy this product.  You have to prepare the chips hours in advance of actually cooking them (if using fresh) - you have to soak and dry the potatoes well in advance of wanting to cook them - so if you just fancy a bowl of chips one evening - you have to plan about an hour in advance.  On the upside, i really did use a teaspoon of oil and they were absolutly delicious helathy chips that come out."
"It took me a while to get used to using this, but when I did, it makes great chips and potato wedges.  You do have to add a little oil though to improve the flavour and also cook for a little longer than recommended.<br><br>My only gripe would be that it is a little small to produce enough chips for a family of four.  Also it didn't come with a food divider? Which for me, given that I only cook chips in it, isn't a problem."
"We have been buying oven-ready chips because they are quicker, far less messy and supposedly healthier than home made deep fried chips. The AirFryer changed that. It takes 3 miutes to heat up, unlike the oven which can take 20 minutes or more. It cooks the chips in 20 minutes to perfection and only uses 1/2 a tablespoon of oil. These really are the best tasting chips I have ever made. Tried sweet potato fries the other day. Delicious. The AirFryer is easy to clean as well. Well worth the money."
"I am impressed by the machine, though it is lacking the divider mentioned in the User Manual as part of the package. The end result (I don't use pre-cooked frozen chips but instead of soaking I parboil the cut chips), while soft on the inside and crispy on the out, is bland in taste. I guess the oil in deep-frying adds quite a lot of flavour. This is not a complaint, however - getting chips of this quality is brilliant, and a bit of S&P, some ground oregano and a bit of Apple Vinegar takes care of the blandness wonderfully. Very happy with this, but the hype is just that - hype."
"This is an excellent fryer if you are cooking frozen chip or making your own conventional chips, plus cooking other foods with little or no oil. Well done Philips an excellent product."
"It operates exactly like it says, except that the noise level can be equated to Concord taking off from Heathrow."
"This is the very best way to fry anything without the use of oil or fat. I use it every day and I have lost weight."
"The marketing is very misleading because you are sometimes instructed to add oil, and when you're not supposed to add oil, the results are dripping in fat.<br><br>The AirFryer is basically a tiny fan assisted oven, and because the AirFryer does not extract oil-laden air while it's cooking, the results are not very healthy. With no added oil, my well-excised free range chicken came out basically roasted, but dripping in it's own fat. For non-oily food, Phillips suggest adding half a tablespoon: that is actually a lot of oil! Based on my experience, most of the oil in the AirFryer is going to be delivered on the food. In contrast, with a deep fat fryer, most of the oil stays in the fryer. For healthy eating, the AirFryer does not come close to grilling or steaming.<br><br>Based on this experience, I'd rather not try Phillips' suggestion to cook pre-oiled oven chips in the AirFryer. I'll continue to use it with low-oil home Recipes only. This raises a different problem:<br><br>On one hand, I can now put my oven into my dishwasher, so I am keeping my greasy AirFryer. On the other hand, the AirFryer is not as easy to clean as a frying pan or deep fat fryer. This is because the AirFryer's materials are not non-stick, and they're also not coated in a layer of protective oil - I had expected more thought to have been put into choice of materials."
"So pleased we purchased this excellent delivery too this is my fav tool in the kitchen now brilliant item thanks"
"This fab kitchen gadget cooks literally everything! Also saves time! Great to use with my slimming world diet all in my group have one :-)"
"I love my air fryer would not be with out one now.the way the chips and other food cook faster"
"I love this item and it makes fantastic chips, i haven't tried anything else yet. I was looking to use the divider one day but saw it was not included, i got in touch with Amazon who were fantastic as usual and told me they had a prompt on the screen for me to contact philips. I did and was told by philips this version did not contain the divider and they have had a few queries and need to make this clearer for customers.  If i had known i may have paid more for the one with the divider for future baking. Still pleased with the product though."
"Since I purchased this, I have used it practically every day.  It is a brilliant appliance, and I don't know how I managed without it.  My favourite thing is cheese on bread and cooked in the airfryer.  Mmmm... lovely."
"This Airfryer is a godsend, I love it. I would just replace it if it broke, I couldn't live without one now."
"This was delivered within days and has proved invaluable,  No more smelly oil in the kitchen.  Does the job it say brilliantly - would definitely recommend!"
"Brilliant. easy to use, clear instruction, cuts down cooking times with excellent results. A bit bigger than I expected but does not get too hot when in use."
"I was wary of buying this just because it is pricey & that I had never owned one before but, no worries at all.<br>It works perfectly & really does do everything it claims & it does it well. A great product."
"I got this as my tefal actify broke down, and I missed my chips!! Excellent price, got it in sale for £99, bargin !! Cooks brilliantly, quickly and looks lovely! Easy to clean and use. Very happy with this!!"
"This is a brilliant bit of kit. I can now enjoy the food that I used to regard as 'naughty' with a clear conscience! It's also a dream to keep clean - my life has changed forever! Well done Phillips!"
"We absolutely love our Philips Air Fryer, so much so that as soon as it comes back to the £80 mark we will get another.<br>its brilliant for roasting vegetables, and any product that is battered or with breadcrumbs or any food with coating comes out perfectly crispy and cooked, no more soggy fish fingers or wet batter.<br>Our only moan is I need 2 lol"
"The first AirFryer was lost in transit but the replacement arrived as promised. So far we have cooked pork chops, chicken portions, sausages, fish cakes, chips and red peppers all very successfully. The fryer is easy to use and looks attractive sitting in the kitchen so it won't become one of the five minute wonder white elephants!"
"Bought the Phillips air fryer on recommendation and it did not disappoint . Really easy to use and I use it daily. The chips are fantastic but also use to cook butternut squash and roast other veg."
"I read the reviews from others and wasn't sure what fryer to go for but definitely made the right decision.  Best tasting homemade chips with zero fat content really. .I recommend this fryer"
"I wached the video that is shown with this product,and it shows you a basket divider??. when I opened the box there wasn't one,so I looked at the product description and it says the one I bought doesn't have one (HD9220 ).where does it say this in the product selling description. does anyone know where I can buy one of the basket dividers ??."
"Not used yet but looks very good and description was very good. price great as alot cheaper than others would recommend."
"i love this airfryer  iwould recommend it to every 1 and amazon had a great reduced down in price sale on it made it even better"
"Love this air fryer, so useful and no oil needed! Makes everything a little more crispy though! In general excellent job! My mother loves it! easy to use too."
"anyone trying to keep to a low fat diet or Slimming World members wanting tohave chips,also good for cooking sausages."
"clean, quick, and versatile . So far I have tried, pate,cake. fish chips, pies, all very successful, the larger model would be needed for a family of 4 or more."
"I love this now. It takes time to get the hang of it especially for fries but its great once you've mastered it. I must admit, I've not used it for much else though I keep meaning to."
"Although this machine is actually very good I was disappointed to find that parts were not included. The livery on the box states the machine can also grill and bake however if you want to bake then you will need to purchase Accessories such as the ovendish. This part however is mentioned more than once in the recipe booklet included with the fryer. Another accessory not included is the food separator. For me this is essential for keeping chips away from chicken whilst cooking for instance.<br>I had intended to experiment and use the machine to its full potential but without paying out extra it is not possible to do this. If all you want to do is cook chips, then this is great but is that really worth £110 or even £95 now that it has been reduced.?"
"I bought this because I loved the concept, the taste of fried chips but with less fat, what could be better?!<br>In reality, it works very well, it cooks evenly, but not as quickly as the book says, it's no quicker than a conventional oven, certainly for chips..<br>They come out really crispy, exactly as described, but they are dry and tasteless, so the addition of lots of salt, vinegar, mayo and ketchup was required.  Quite honestly, I have found that for the best chips, use frying chips, in the oven with a drizzle of sunflower/olive oil to coat them, then give them 20-25 minutes at 200 degrees c, they come out far better than any oven chip and certainly a lot better than this.<br>It is huge as well, if you have a small kitchen you will struggle to find a home for it!  Also, it gives off a lot of steam when in use, so don't do as I did and stand it under the wall cupboards, with lights above, they started to flicker as they were shorting out from the moisture!!<br>So over all, in my opinion, a good product if you want low fat but tasteless chips, it is well made and does do what it says it will, but as with anything, you have to remember that if you remove the fat, you remove the flavour. Oven chips are better cooked in the oven and real chips, well they can be done in the oven as well, with far better results than using this, so if you do them as I have explained above, you will be far better off and save yourself £99!"
"I bought this because we usually do our deep fat frying outdoors and my husband makes superb chips. However,<br>the Jury's still out.  Husband is not quite sure it fries chips as well as he does ( well you would expect him to say that)<br>Maris Piper potatoes are recommended, but you can't buy them on Crete. We followed the instructions on size of chips, soaking etc. Nevertheless, I am happy with it's performance, it cooked spring rolls beautifully and without smell.<br>We just need to keep experimenting with greek potatoes."
"Love not having any smell of fat or all the mess associated with a  chip frying pan,but do find it can cook a little unevenly despite shaking the chips. However I am pleased with the fryer and need to do more experimenting. Cutting out fat in the diet is great."
"When I bought this product it arrived broken, Amazon were amazing and couldn't be faulted the service was outstanding.<br>I now wish I had bought this, when it was first released,  chips are first class taking only 20mins and very little fat used.<br>Fried bread only takes 4 or 5 mins (soak bread in olive oil first}. My crumble only takes 25mins at 160*.<br>Overall a first claw product."
"Although this product may be limited, it certainly accommodates myself<br> & husband, l find it efficient, quick & easy to use & saves on energy as l don't have to put on for 15 minutes to heat up, as l would an oven, It  also cooks the food quicker & Its also much healthier than using a chip pan for chips & nicer tasting than oven chips. So overall l would recommend."
"Wish I bought one earlier so much healthier and its amazing what you can cook in it.great buy would recommend."
"Bought this to make healthy chips, great invention chips come out crispy and tasty,  even though its big and takes up a lot of bunker space it looks good! It's so easy to use and Cleaning is also very easy, well worth the money."
"I looked around the net and this seemed to get the best review.  Chips certainly are different to the greasy home fries I used to cook, but I've got to loose weight and at least this way I can still have my chips. It takes surprisingly little oil to coat the chips before cooking, I've even tried the Fry Light spay at only 1 cal per spray.  I still crave the grease and fat but this fryer allows you a healthy lifestyle, Thanks to Philips I can still have my chips"
"It is the second one I have purchased and this is nothing like the first one. It is dangerous, when I pull the drawer out with hot cooked food in, the bottom half drops apart,  leaving me holding the just basket, which it should not do. It is a much poorer Quality."
"The Airfryer did as it said. Fantastic crispy healthy chips. Good recipe ideas. easy to use. What's not to love!"
"The fryer cooks okay but chip's don't taste the same there not as crispy as they are in a deep fatfyier but are great for frying things like sausages I have roasted frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes and they both taste great I have yet to try anything else the recipe book,  suggest."
"glad i purchased the air fryer wish i had done it long time ago.its quick , easy clean and odourless"
"I bought this on a whim as I wanted to start making my own chips and really did not want all the Hassles and dangers of deep fat fryers or chip pans.<br><br>Having seen it on The Gadget Show (where it came out top when compared to other similar products) I felt £85 was a fair price and as I had just been given £80 in Amazon vouchers I decided to give it a go.<br><br>First impressions are that the unit appears to be very well made and it cooks a delicious portion of chips. They do taste a little different compared to 'proper' chips, but the only way to describe that difference is 'less oily'. Of course, oily chips are delicious but rather unhealthy so this small sacrifice is worth it. They still taste great, which is important to note, just not quite the same.<br><br>I'm currently experimenting with seasonings and different potatoes to try and achieve perfection, but I was happy with the results from the off.<br><br>One of the main benefits is how easy it is to clean. I don't have a dishwasher, so I wash the basket and drawer in the sink like I would was a frying pan. The only difference is it's quicker and easier than washing a frying pan.<br><br>There was one accessory I thought would be included but wasn't; a drawer divider for cooking two things at once. It wasn't mentioned in the advert but I had read about it in one of the online reviews. As it turns out, this is only included in Australia and South Korea but I contacted Philips customer care and they were kind enough to send me one free of charge. They were very helpful and I have only good things to say about their post-sales service.<br><br>The only criticism I can come up with is the basket size itself. If I am making chips (for 2 adults and 1 child) I fill the basket, meaning I still need to use the oven for the rest of the meal. I'm not sure how some people claim to have stopped using their oven completely, but this is a limiting factor for me. Of course, there is a larger (and obviously, more expensive) version so I feel it would be unfair to mark it down on this basis.<br><br>I have tried cooking a couple of other things in this, but I have to agree with the majority in that this will more than likely be used solely for chips in your house and mine (partially due to the limited basket size mentioned above). From that point of view it is a bit of a one-trick-pony, albeit a premium one. However, this was the primary reason for my purchase and in that regard it does a magnificent job.<br><br>** UPDATE **<br><br>Having tried a few different methods, I can now make chips that are BETTER tasting than those delicious deep fried chips. This is such an amazing product and the price has now dropped to £75 so I can't recommend this highly enough!"
"Five stars for performance and the taste of the food is excellent. Easier to keep clean than deep fryers. Bonus in being able to do fish alongside the chips with no taste transfer. Amazed at the number of different foods cooked so easily."
"Looked at buying a tefal but the reviews were better for the Phillips and made my first chips with anticipation but must say they were really nice, tried chunky, fries and frozen and haven't been disappointed at all I have made several other items in the airfryer and highly recommend, well worth purchased which I had from Amazon"
"Wish we had bought one of these fryers years ago. Healthy, fast and crunchy. Tip, if you get chips from the chippy, ask for them half cooked and finish them off in the airfryer. You will be amazed at the amount of fat residue is left in the bottom tray!"
"I was so happy I've found the perfect solution for frying chips and other food. It sounded promising, healthy, easy to use and it was kind of easy. But soon after it started to work, the awful smell of burning plastic filled the whole house. And the chips tasted and smelled of burned plastic. Really strong. Washing and repeating the process didn't help at all, Having wasted three meals it was the time to send it back.<br>It's a huge disappointment as the place for any fryer in the kitchen is empty now. It was sad and maybe even traumatic experience, especially for the kids.<br>We've got the refund."
"I use it sporadically as its too big to keep on the worktop, Only makes enough chips for small portion for two people"
"I've bought this fryer because of recommendations from a friend of mine and especially for making french fries. It's good and did the job. However in the instruction manual the producer has put a stress on explanations through pictures. I find it not very good. It will be more useful if done through text. Maybe the idea is to save the translation to different languages and develop the imagination of the user but if the first step is not very successful the user starts to stare in the pictures thinking: Am I stupid or the pictures are not explanatory enough!<br>However we used it many times, changing something with every try. Finally, I think, we made it! Not really like the real frying, but some how ... So, do not expect the same taste as we know from the past, the not healthy one!"
"what a product fantastic,didnt eat fired food but this allows me to eat chips etc without eating high levelsof saturatd fat,my wife oes all manners of food in it and as their are only 2 of us she uses this rather that the big old oven /arived very quickly would recomend"
"Absolutely love it. !!! Can cook almost anything in it, bacon, chops, grilled cheese, vegetables. Require nine or very little oil but everything comes out crispy, browned but very healthy.<br>Still experimenting, but yesterday cooked a Brie wrapped in pastry and it was wonderful.<br>Easy to clean"
"I got one of these thinking they would make my food taste 10x better, I think I was too optimistic about this!<br><br>However, the food does cook nicely and it's used every meal time - the timer has some slight fault where by it stops it around 1 minute rather than time up (nothing major really) and the actual size of the cooking draw isn't too big. (manage though)<br><br>Otherwise does as it states on the tin."
"Brilliant. Really pleased with chips. I like brown chips so leave them cook a bit longer and they come out great.<br>I do find that the more you shake them the more even the colour. If you just shake them the once I get some white bits, but they are still cooked<br><br>No mess no smell easy to clean but if you try moving the chips with a fork they tend to break, so I shake them.  Pan does get hot if you try shaking it using two hands so use an oven glove.<br><br>Timer switches the machine off so if you have started doing something else the chips will wait until you are ready for the second cook<br><br>Some points to watch for : remember to adjust the cooking temperature for the second cook, you have to cut the chips and soak them for at least 30 mins before cooking but they are worth the wait"
"Well we've had this a month now and have to say once you get used to cooking times the chips come out golden, crisp on the outside and soft inside .. 1st batch were over cooked and the were like sticks just shattered when stabbed with a fork, by batch number 3 great.  Best option mccain big bag half a basket for 12 minutes shake then a further 8 minutes, if you like fries 6mins shake and 6 mins more, if you prefer steak chips fresh from potatoes then 10 mins shake and 8 minutes"
"Excellent appliance, works a charm and the results are A1.  Chips, meatballs, croquettes, sausages, vegetables - everything comes out just like it was fried but without that fatty, oily taste.  Also it is so easy to clean and can even go in the dishwasher.  Excellent, recommended, product.<br><br>I looked at the ActiFry first, but the reviews I read mentioned things like the elements burning out, plus the mechanical food stirrer breaking and even having the product catch fire! (I think this was on older machines though).  The element on the Philips Airfryer is a sturdy, grill, type element.  Also I didn't like the very large footprint of the Actifry as this would take up a lot of worktop space, whereas the Philips Airfryer is quite tall, it doesn't take up too much space.<br><br>The only two points I would like to note are: Do be carefull with the food once cooked as it seems to retain its heat far longer than when fried traditionally - and it gets hot!!! The second point is that the food pan which is mentioned in the product blurb is not, in fact, included - so without this you can't cook omelettes or any similar foodstuffs."
"I just love my Philips Airfryer. It make my life easier and most importantly is, healthier (frying without oil)! I showed it to my friends, and they also bought it for themselves later. I really recommended this to others. I cooked salmon, chicken, fries and the taste are wonderful! Stop thinking and place your order :)"
"Cooks food really brilliantly, not very noisy cheaper than an actifry and I can  enjoy foods such as roasted veg and chips with no fat at all. only down side is when cooking chips they need shaking or string every 4-5 minutes which is a bit of a paoin but worth it food tastes amazing, is worth the money would recommend if want a cheaper version of the actifry"
"Have used this a few times now and it is great.<br>I have only used it for making chips up to now but cannot stress enough how easy it is to use and how good the chips are.<br>Would recommend to anyone who wants to eat healthily. Instructions with it tells how to use and cook other food."
"love this item cook real chips, frozen chips nice and crispy and with no fat. Great for other foods too, swap your deep fat fryer for one of these highly recommend.<br><br>just lightly coat chips with oil and use as you would a chip pan, shake about abit and the results are very close better if you ask me as theres no dripping fat.<br><br>dishwasher it when needed, its pretty clean most of the time, you wouldnt change the oil in your chip pan every time would you."
"I use the philips air fryer everyday. fish and chips are done perfect, cheese on toast is yummy and i even cook part baked rolls in it, sausages, chicken, burgers and even sausage rolls are lovely, mushrooms and toms are scrummy the list goes on and on. I love this product so much i have even brought one for my mum and my nan."
"Amazing, with a half teaspoon of olive oil, the most delicious chips. What's more I don't feel guilty at all because its olive oil! Great product but does need attending to shake the basket every few minutes if you want your chips evenly browned."
"Absolutely love it. I was abit dubious with mixed reviews I heard but chips are cooked in no time at all"
"When looking for a healthy fryer, this Philips was an option. After reading some of the reviews I was convinced this airfryer would meet my expectations. And it does! I'm very pleased with it. Next to that the price was very pleasant, and it was delivered within a few days to the Netherlands!"
"Bought for someone else but they love it.  Very easy to use, things cook quickly and taste fantastic.  Plenty of space for around 8 chicken legs (SI unit) and blends in nicely to the black worktops so you hardly tell it's there.  Great product which I handily get sent food from :)"
"this is just amazing. even if you need to learn how to cook with it, you can really eat and make lot of food with it and without any bad feeling to eat it (i mean, oil free).<br>if you have kids which like chips, chicken fingers, nuggets and so on, its just amazing.<br>buy it, even for your small party with your friends, all will be amazed with it and food is tasty"
"Bought this for my wife who is on the Slimming world regime<br><br>It is a Fantastic we now have abandoned the oven for making healthy chips, baked potatoes or anything else you would put in there.<br><br>If you use Fry Light rather than Oil on the chips when cooking you get great results and they are FREE on Slimming world.<br><br>Revolutionised healthy food in the house<br><br>Its a little loud but no more than a fan oven or Microwave."
"We were initially hesitant about buying this as it's quite expensive but would not be without it now! It cooks everything we throw in it to perfection.<br><br>It does chips great, both home made and frozen. Frozen chips generally only take about 12 mins on 180, where as home made take around 25-30 depending on how well you like them done. I don't use oil as I'm trying to lose weight, so I make my home made chips using frylight. I don't bother soaking for 30 mins either, just cut them up, spray them and in they go. The best frozen chips are McCain Home Style Crinkly - gorgeous! I pretty much stick to home made though as they're less cals, I like to do charlotte/new potatoes with their skins on, just chop, spray and pop them in. Really nice and great for the likes of Slimming World, a lot less messing around than \"slimming world chips\", no par boiling necessary!<br><br>They cook any frozen \"breadcrumb\" type food great, scampi, battered chicken, vegetarian sausages/burgers, all Quorn products, spring rolls, bhaji's etc.<br><br>Cooking time is much less time than using an oven! Easy to clean, just pop the drawer and the basket into soak and they come out great. Couldn't recommend it more!"
"Following the instructions, the chips were just the job.  I am tackling other foods along the same lines with success, such as cauliflower and sprouts.  No success with batter covered foods!"
"Very good product.I am pleased I purchased the larger model as it holds more than enough for four people quite easily.I will not return to the old way of cooking chips."
"We have not had much success with anything else in it but oven chips come out great - not greasy and super crisp and with less calories hopefully"
"Fantastic product.<br>Easy to use and easy to clean, it accommodates bigger portions than you may think looking at the compact and stylish line.<br>This appliance not only cooks evenly, it also cooks food quicker than a conventional oven.<br>Worth every penny.<br>Great buy."
"I'm really impressed with the results I get from this Airfryer. Frozen chips are quick and easy and come out perfect every time and it makes everything crisp and crunchy. The only thing that stops me giving it 5 stars is the fact that I like the taste of an oil/fat fryer but thats the compromise for healthier food and it still tastes awesome."
"Got one of these for my wife last year and she loves it.<br><br>Can't do too much in it, but it is superb fr quick meals like chips/pizzas etc.<br><br>Amazingly quick and clean.<br><br>Niw bought another one for my parents."
"The Amazon advert was incorrect and miss leading as the product is not as advertised ie. There is no separator in the package this is clearly advertised in the video of the product. On contacting Phillips the product for the European market does not have a separator. The separator  was the  main reason for purchasing this product over other brands.<br>Very very disappointing !!!"
"I bought this after refusing to buy a deep fat fryer then nearly setting the kitchen on fire using a saucepan<br>They say that if something stays on the kitchen worktop, it must be useful. Well this has never been in the cupboard and we use it regularly. I don't bother making roast potatoes in the oven any more as they are fantastic done in the air fryer and frozen chips are done in a matter of a few minutes. I admit that it is used for what would have gone in a DFF but it has never failed to produce a better result and in less time<br>i have not tried it for cakes etc, but if I never do that, it will still be worth the money<br>One great feature is that if you have left chips or roast potatoes to go cold, they can be warmed up in a matter of minutes and still taste great. Much better than using the microwave<br>Other reviews have said that you have to shake the basket, which is true, but usually you are in the kitchen anyway and would have to shake a DFF as well, so what is the difference<br><br>Don't hesitate, buy it now. I know it is expensive compared with a deep fat fryer, but you will not regret it"
"Having looked into buying this item, when we went to the shops, all we could find was the newer (higher wattage) version and as we wanted to use this in our caravan - we needed the original lower wattage one - which we found via amazon. Cooks frozen chips best but is a good alternative to deep fat frying."
"A very good machine but I didn't realise quite how big it was before I ordered it, so storage could be a problem in a small kitchen. Sweet potato chips are brilliant cooked in it...I just give them a light spray of oil and they take about 15 minutes only to cook and that's quite chunky ones."
"The product is a fantastic idea but after for months the plastic surround on the drawer is warped and the drawer won't go back in.  It is now therefore useless."
"Was really excited to use it brought the ingredients to do the ratatouille and the soup. Came home to start it all and then realised I needed a ovenware dish to go into the tray. I didn't have one small enough. So was disappointed that I couldn't start to use it. You need an ovenware dish of if round 20cm or square 19x19 cm on outer edges no more than 8cm deep. It does state this in the booklet that comes with the air fryer but if your like me I tend to not read everything. Once brought the dishes the food was excellent very tasty. Would recommend to everyone. Have spoken to other people who say they just put the food directly in the fryer without the basket I did try this but found it a little messy. But it did work."
"Pros:<br>+Awesome taste when cooking meat. Soft, tender and juicy fried meat.<br>+Chips are also great.<br>+Very fast cooking.<br>+Energy efficient.<br>+Excellent build Quality.<br>Cons:<br>-A bit bulky, for the amount of food that it cooks.<br>-The cooking tray sometimes is hard to clean even with a brush.<br>-Price is high.<br><br>The device instantly made up for the high price, after I fried some lean chicken breast with mustard sauce. Or pork etc.<br><br>This is not a fancy device with little use. This is a machine that I use daily, makes my life a lot easier, and my diet healthier."
"I already have an Actifry with rotating paddle, but sometimes items would break up in the pan.  This doesn't happen with the airfryer.  The only criticism I have is that the basket (while ideal for chips) doesn't accommodate a very big bowl for items of a liquid nature.  Not sure if there was a larger model available - if so - my mistake!  Other advantages over the Actifry is the variable temperature and timer control.  Also switches off when cooking complete which my Actifry does not."
"Excellent product. I just wish I had bought one sooner. It is now the most used item in my kitchen. You can cook almost anything in it. Very fast cooking time. Great price and fast delivery. A must have for any ones kitchen. Great for kids and adults alike. You don't have to use any fat. Great :)"
"First time using Amazon warehouse, extremely impressed with the the fact that the item was in perfect condition; I wasn't expecting this, thought it would have some shop soiling, especially as the price was so reasonable! Also arrived promptly and well packaged. Would definitely use this seller again. Have only used this product once so far, but is very simple to use, but I should have washed the inside and the drawer first, as it tainted the food very slightly with the newness!"
"For any health conscious buyers this is the perfect choice, good for fresh chips or frozen. All in all a really good purchase,"
"Does exactly what it says no mess cleans easy chips are not greasy and taste good. I haven't cooked anything else yet."
"Have had this item for quite a while now and it is not stuck at the back of a cupboard unloved and rarely used.  Had a few teething problems to begin with, not using enough oil (anyone who can get away with 1 spoonful obviously has no taste buds) chips not cooking in middle and hard and inedible, potato stuck to bottom of basket like cement!!  However after reading other peoples reviews I have it sussed now I parboil the potatoes, then put some oil in a tray and shake the chips in it till coated and I put a small piece of tinfoil in bottom of basket until chips begin to cook then it can be removed, the result is the most wonderful home cooked chips and wedges (skin on) and oven chips are amazing (especially Asda Leith school of food type).  The fryer is used at least once a week and we have not been near a chip shop since!! Highly recommend."
"First time of using tonight to do chips for 6 people, firstly you cannot fill the basket to full capacity as it does not cook in the recommended time, in fact it took nearly 40 minutes to cook the chips, and had to do two lots,  the chips were quite nice, but did put in the oven to crisp up more.  Not sure that it is meant for more than a couple of portions.  Like the concept to healthier eating tho.  would give this 6/10."
"This is now one of the most used appliances in my kitchen you can cook almost anything in it and you save on calories as you need only a spray of low cal oil has helped me wonders in shifting weight without sacrificing too much of the foods I love"
"Have found this excellent ! No fatty smells . Cooks chips to perfection . Also chicken , lamb - the world is your oyster!!!!  Very easy to clean . But it is very large . Make sure you have room for it first!"
"This is a fantastic appliance.great design, easy to use, fast delivery, I am happy with this philips airfryer,my friends also bought this machine"
"the fryer was a little damaged on the bottom apart from that everything was good and does what i got it for"
"love this product .very usefull cooks most items very clean and easy to clean will reccommend to others also good value"
"I love this product.<br>So much better than an old chip pan, and much healthier too.<br>I don't even use any oil when cooking the frozen chips, it doesn't need it."
"This is a great fryer to have, I have only used it a hand full of times so far and have been very happy with the results. No more nasty smells that you would normally get from a normal chip fryer. I look forward to trying out plenty more different types of food in it. If you want to start cooking healthier foods and that are not soaked in oil then this is well worth buying I am glad I brought mine."
"I bought this fryer after visiting my brother and seeing it in action, it cooks the food to perfection without the added hassle of adding oil and purchased the same fryer immediately and was put to use as soon as it arrived, the only downside it never came with the divider and having contacted Philips they despatched it immediately."
"I started using it with some clues I got from cooking blogs and I can tell it works. Not only it allows me to do other stuff while cooking but also it is easy to clean after usage. The food is really nice, sometimes better than the traditional way. I used it to prepare meat balls, french fries and hamburguers. I suggest to not mix different kind of food inside to avoid mixing flavors."
"It does make surprisingly good chips and potato cubes. U can use frozen chips, waffles, alphabites, fritters etc and they come out super yummy. Ive yet to try other foods tho was a bit disappointed that u cant cook sausages in it like u can do with some of the other health fryers.<br>It washes fairly easy and i like that i can control the temp with this one. I do recommend it for anyone trying to eat more healthily but misses chips.<br>I also recommend that u buy a chip cutter as the chips do need to be about the same size n thickness to cook at the same time."
"couldnt live without this  - its fast , efficient and food tastes absolutely amazing. Very quick and we dont know how we lived without one before! We never deep fried but most things went in the oven - now most things go in the air fryer"
"Had a tefal actifry before hand which i dropped and smashed, thought i would give the airfryer a go. Its okay, alot easier to keep clean and looks better in the kitchen but i do prefer the chips by the actifry. Chips in the airfryer just don't come out as tasty.<br>Done sausage in the airfryer though and they were lovely but you do have to place the airfryer near a window as it stinks the house out. Haven't tried frozen chips in it though."
"I'm very pleased with my purchase. It's keeps tasted good and it's very easy to use. I just love my air fryer!!!!"
"This was purchased as a replacement for our Actifry which had more or less dropped apart due to overuse.  I love it, it is more flexible than the Actifry in that it does not break up delicate food, though I did manage to cook samosas in the Actifry.  I must confess to slipping into the same rut as I did with the aforementioned Actifry by only cooking potatoes but it does do wonderful jacket potatoes and chips and any of the other processed potato products that are on the market.  It also reheats pies very well but so far have not tried cooking one from the raw state.  It makes wonderful Southern Fried Chicken and the pineapple recipe (if you like pineapple and coconut) in the recipe book that accompanies it, is to die for."
"Fantastic product. Use it all the time. So quick and everything tastes much nicer cooked in it. Great value as well. size up from this (not much bigger) more than twice the price in some high street stores"
"We love it would never go back to anything else easy to clean quick to cook makes meal times easier and no smells"
"Really good piece of kit. No smelly chip oil smells. Food tastes good after cooking in it. Really healthy eating for us now."
"This cooks oven chips properly in 10 minutes.<br>It is great for heating pies and flans as the pastry is always crisp.<br>It's very quick too.<br>You can actually cook a small cake in it.<br>I tried that and it was well cooked.<br>All in all ,a healthier way to cook fatty food.<br>One tip,if I'm cooking anything fatty,like bacon,I line the bottom with a piece of foil,then throw it away afterwards.<br>It saves so much cleaning.The removable parts do go in the dishwasher though."
"This Airfryer by Philips is very good for cooking all types of meat. Sausage & chicken excellent! Chips are fine from frozen or real, just spray with fry light. Although you do have to shake them up a few types, to stop them sticking together. Cooked lovely sponge cake too!<br>Only negatives, the basket is not so easy to clean and this model does not come with the dividing plate!!"
"Well packaged solid item<br>Have only cooked chippies in it since buying it, but they are the best homemade chips we have had in a long time<br>Easy to use.....always remember to take basket out to shake the chips.....they are a little bit dry, but they taste divine<br>Best fryer I have ever had and so easy to clean....no rotten oil to dispose of and no horrid oily smell in the hose<br>Extremely pleased and am recommending it as a good useful item....looking forward to cooking other things as it comes with a fantastic recipe booklet :o)"
"no more smelling fring oil and best for fish finger and other  frying stuff you no he he he he"
"ONE OF MY BEST BUYS"
"Not impressed, i,m sorry i bought this item and also hard to clean the grill. I would advise  all to leave well alone."
"Love it!<br>Big enough for a good portion of chips for four (if you're not greedy) they cook crispy and no more messy oil.  Just did 12 small sausage rolls which turn out lovely.<br> Obviously its not too big  but everything I've tried comes out great, downside bit small for desserts ."
"Pretty good, chips come out almost as if they were deep fried. My teens use this regularly to make home made, fries, chips and sweet potato fries - never seen them so active in the kitchen.  easy to use, easy to clean. A nice to have in the kitchen."
"A fantastic product producing really tasty food<br> I find it brilliant at cooking frozen chips. No preparation, no need to add oil so a really healthy option ready from frozen in 15 minutes. I put them in frozen and then start the machine Brilliant!"
"This is a well used appliance around the kitchen- cooks way more than chips ! the chips are good and it will do frozen fish and chips for one in about10 minutes. cooking a small batch of home made fresh chips is a little quicker- I find its about 2/3rds of the time quoted on packets for most oven-able foods- have cooked breaded chicken steaks and sausages in it as well, and the vegetarian food comes out nicely too- makes a brilliant method of cooking tempura prawns from the supermarket that otherwise can be a bit oily for my taste, would buy again in a heartbeat."
"Love this, simple to use and cuts out all the fat. I've made wedges, chips, fries, lamb chops, somosas... It's great!"
"what a wonderful product"
"Supplier very promp and well packaged t but unfortunately do not rate air fryer as chips are crispy for about 10 seconds then they go flat - yuk"
"Really pleased, would definately recommend."
"Could not recommend this highly enough... this is a must buy item at a fantastic price (£89.99) when I bought.<br><br>If you follow the instructions the first few times then experiment a bit with your food, it works perfectly well and is VERY low maintenance."
"BRILLIANT AND HALF THE price OF THE TEFAL FAT FREE FRYER. FULLY RECOMMEND"
"This is the best kitchen appliance you can buy I have bought 5 now one for my self the rest as Christmas gifts for family and they love it to and are recommending it to their friend and family  too"
"I already have one one of these which i bought a few years ago and use on a daily basis with no problems. I decided to buy this one for my son because it is so easy to use and makes chips without the use of oil. However it has only been used a handful of times because once the fryer heats the pull out drawer wont go back into the machine. It was to be banged on a few times before it goes back in. By the time you do this the temperature inside it has dropped.  When cooking most foods have to be taken out halfway through their recommended time to be shaken you then have the nightmare senario of getting the drawer back in. i know this must be afault on this particular fryer as the identical one i have doesnt have any problems whatsoever. I didnt keep the original box so couldnt return it. Wouldve given the actual fryer 5 stars but due to the problems with the drawer on this particular one i have knocked a few stars off."
"This product is fantastic!!! it is one of the best things I have ever bought and would  and have recommended it to everyone,once you use it you will wonder how you did without it.It cooks chicken superbly and if you are in a hurry jacket potatoes and roast type potatoes are beautifully cooked."
"A good product but it does have a couple of minor flaws. The temperature setting dial would be better if it clicked on the different settings. Also the mains lead is a bit short. Now for cooking its excellent although you may need to \"experiment\" if you use proper potatoes to make chips instead of using oven chips as the results can vary depending on thetype of potato used."
"I love this item.  It is very over priced compared to other kitchen electrical items, but as a single person this item allows me to bake and roast without using a large oven.... And of course using less oil..."
"Brilliant for chips, it has to be said. It heats up quickly, which is nice, and holds a reasonable quantity of chips. It's good for reheating previously cooked items, and I have tried some of the recipes from the booklet which came with the fryer with some degree of success, but if one wants to do 'something and chips', for example, the basket of the fryer will only hold one thing at a time, which means resorting to the oven."
"Love this airfryer use it a lot top marks for delivery and product"
"its great, no smell when cooking, easy to clean, healthy as well, cooks food quickly, chips are nice and crispy."
"with no moving parts really good, had the other sort lid broke and arm kept getting stuck"
"Wonderful gadget.  Have 'fried' frozen chips - much better than oven cooked, resulting in crispy outer and fluffy inner chips.  Have also fried mixed veg (peppers, onions etc) with great results and so fast with very little cooking smells in the kitchen.  Fast delivery and a good price."
"it works very well. However, the capacity of 800g is pretty small. I can only grill 3 pork chops and it is not enough to put one whole chicken as the demonstration on you tube has shown."
"Really surprised how quick this is. Items are not sitting in fat while cooking. Not using my oven much at all now. Cooks sausages  great, no need to turn them, cooks evenly all round. Still experimenting on what I can cook in there.<br>Only downer is there is not divider to the basket. Would be nice to have one to use when you want."
"My daughter bought this for us from Amazon, seven months ago.  We found the Recipes and advised cooking times in the literature to be rather poor but persisted and eventually found our own Recipes and times to prepare most acceptable chips.  The problem with the unit is the design associated with the food basket and the bottom drawer.  A feeble clip holds the bottom drawer to the food basket which is regularly removed to shake, during cooking.  A thumb press on top of the handle allows the battom draw to detach before the basket is shaken.  Sadly, the design is far from adequate.  On a number of occasions, our bottom draw has detached without the use of the thumb release, and today, the draw reached its final resting place on the kitchen tiles, in many pieces.  We had not pressed the release mechanism and did not shake.  The drawer simply detached and shattered.<br><br>The four screws holding the release mechanism (Philips!) had also worked loose.  No design awards for Philips and the brand name is something to be given a wide berth in the future.  It's a healthy cooking concept but it has not passed GCSE design and Technology."
"Minimal oil.. Healthy.. Easy.."
"Excellent easy to use and make fantastic chips and other foods. You can taste the food not any oil."
"Really easy to use we love it. It would be nice if the dial timer was lite."
"Good price and efficient"
"Great.  Use all the time.  Easy to clean."
"I bought one of these around 15 months ago, and I can honestly say that I've not used the oven since.<br><br>I had wanted one for ages but I waited until I had some extra money, and I honestly think it's the best thing I've ever bought.<br><br>I've baked fairy buns in it, small cakes, cooked jacket potatoes, potatoe wedges/waffles/lattices/curly fries, pies, sausage rolls, pasties, onion rings, fish fingers... The list is endless.<br><br>Making things fresh end up taking just delicious, like your own chips, potatoes squares or roast potatoes.<br><br>My mum has made fresh pies in it, I made fresh mince pies with it last Christmas.<br><br>Cooking time is normally half or less of what you'd have with an oven. A pie, from frozen, takes about 15 minutes to cook, and frozen chips take about 10 or so minutes, although you did need to shake them half way through.<br><br>I literally love this thing. Everything tastes better, cooks better, and takes less time.<br><br>10/10 from me. :D"
"this is a must for every kitchen such a versatile product"
"Superb buy and a price in line with the major high street retailers."
"Received very quickly to Spain which is a miracle in itself!  Love the machine, does what it says.  I don't use it for chips but I do throw in the potatoes to roast for Sunday lunch!  Cooks anything would recommend it, however there are only two of us it has rather a small basket so may not be so good for large family.  No fat what more could you ask for?"
"use this all the time great for frozen oven and fry type chips"
"perfect"
"Great item"
"exelent  product  very  happy  with  this  fryer"
"My kitchen best friend!"
"Excellent. Healthier and safer than a traditional fryer."
"This is a great invention. The food was crisp and made ready in minutes from frozen. The first thing I cooked was burger patty. It was disastrous as there was smoke that set the fire alarm off. I was only cooking for a good 8 minutes but the patty was just browning. I'm guessing the oil from the patty splattered over the hot grill of the air fryer that caused the smoke. Overall, its a good buy especially you have a busy life and want a healthy minimal oil diet."
"Cooks food well. Have used it for sausages, chips and chicken fillets. Cooked food quickly, browned sausages nicely.<br>Important not to put too much food in the basket as it won't cook properly."
"Very pleased it cooks chips very well steaks are lovely! I even heat up ready meals in it! I'm still experimenting with it but so far very good ! I like the fact there's no greasey mess to clean up just straight into the dish washer ! And no hanging on smells of frying !"
"The best thing since sliced bread as the saying goes. The fryer cooks very well keeping the food crisp full of flavour with little or no added fat or oil. Sausages cook evenly brown and loose lots of the fat into the bottom of the fryer leaving them much healthier. Chips are crisp and great tasting. I am still experimenting but have found I can cook/ heat most things. One of the best things I have purchased. One thing I must add is the amount you can cook at one time will only feed three, so not much use for a big family but they now make one twice as big so problem solved. There has not been a day I have not used the fryer since its purchase."
"I love this product! Super!"
"I didn't realise it was so versatile when I purchased it. I use it as a grill, an oven as well as for making the best chips ever!!! It's easy to use and clean. A perfect addition to my kitchen"
"Just what the wife wanted and it works great"
"Absolutely fantastic :)"
"Big and beautiful.  Does exactly as advertised.  Only reason it is not a 5 star rating is due the fact that it does use quite a bit of electricity and the inner tray can be a pain to clean.  Otherwise, happy frying!<br><br>Great for any frozen foods that you would normally put in the oven.  I haven't had time to look up more Recipes online but I'm sure there are plenty going around."
"Delivery time was brilliant and the price is amazing however if your buying this as a present, get it sent to an alternative address where the recipient of the present doesn't live as it turns up in clear cellophane ... Consequently when my dad recieved the parcel this morning he also found out what his present was at the same time !"
"Not a good as I was expecting, it still smells of fried food. Chips are more like oven chips than fried. It's ok but not great."
"This is fantastic and so easy to use."
"Delivered on time, no damage and well packaged in the product's original box. Used it for the first time this evening, made marinated chicken drumsticks and French fries. I must say that I was sceptical about the Quality of the food cooked in this way. No more. I first did the chicken for 20 minutes (15 would've been fine too). Perfect is a big word, so I leave it in amazing. Crispy skin and juicy; thoroughly cooked inside. Zero greasiness. The chips in 15 minutes were simply perfect. Better than fried with oil, %100. Crunchy, golden outside and soft and fluffy inside. The only downside is the size of the basket. Is early days yet, but I almost wish I had bought a model with a bigger basket now. Compared to frying the same meal the traditional way, is like comparing the performance of a Ferrari against a push bike. It took less than 40 minutes to have perfectly cooked Chicken and Chips for two people. No smoke, oil-spitting, hardly any smell. Easy to wash and store away. It is also very safe and even kids could use it safely with a little supervision. I think this model is great for people living alone and couples, mostly because of size of basket. I didn't think you could have clean-tasting, delicious fried food without oil, but there it is. So far I can only say good things and strongly recommend this product... is worth it just for the perfect chips!!"
"Love this air fryer, it even removes all the fat from oven chips and they come out crispy but soft in the centre"
"Very efficient delivery service, and the fryer is working very well.  I think this fryer is a very good, Quality item."
"I bought this as a present for my son who has recently moved out.  We already have one ourselves and it is fantastic. Delivery was very quick with great Communication.  Delivered within the given time slot.  I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking to cut down on fat intake as well as save some time as it cooks beautifully as well v quickly."
"cooking results are excellent but it's clumsy in appearance and difficult to fit in with kitchen equipment"
"bought as christmas present but know its good as i got one in white"
"got this for a good price of amazon makes great chips and even frozen ones taste better than when cooked in the oven stays clean because so little oil is used"
"Fantastic cooks all food great cooks cakes as well is not just a fryer should have got one years ago!!!!"
"Someone recommended this to me so I was on the lookout for a decent deal on this model. I wanted a compact air fryer that was quite easy to use with no fussing around with oils, trays, and light weight. When Amazon offered this at half price I bit the bullet and ordered one. It arrived quickly and that evening I thought I would try it out. I was not disappointed... Very easy to use and made the most delicious sweet potato fries within minutes. The kids gobbled them up so I had to make new batch so as to have a few myself.<br><br>Great unit, easy to use, simple to store!!"
"I previously owned an Actifry for about a year and a half so I think i'm in a great position to compare the two products. I bought the Airfryer about 2 weeks and ago and in that time have cooked Home made bread, Muffins, Chips, Bacon, Hashbrowns, Sausages and everything has come out lovely! i'm really impressed how versitile this product is as traditionally people view these as 'Just for chips'.<br><br>The Actifry we owned for a year and a half was only ever used for chips, I always thought it produced good results but was let down in a few ways, the paddle would sometimes mash the potatos up, cause bits to fall off, chips to get stuck at the top so you'd have to knock them back into the dish and my biggest annoyance... when it was finished it would beep but not stop!<br><br>The Airfryer is the complete opposite, it produces lovely crisp chips with a soft fluffy inside, if I had to deduct a point it would be that you have to shake the chips half way through (Which for the sake of 10-15 seconds isnt the end of the world). Some people say you have to soak the chips for 30 minutes in water, I've only done this once out of... 3 occasions and the results were the same whether I soaked them or just rinsed them briefly. You also cannot just 'pour' the oil over them and let it mix around like in the actifry, I normally just chuck them in a dish and quickly put a bit of virgin olive oil over them and mix it around.<br><br>Home made bread - It took 20 minutes in the airfryer (at 160 degrees for those interested) and produced incredible results! Bacon and sausage cooked beautifully, the bacon went lovely and crispy and all the fat was collected in the bottom and well away from the food. We've noticed that food that should be nice and crispy is (Ie: Hashbrowns, Chips) and foods that shouldn't be somehow just aren't (Ie: Cakes.. they go a nice golden colour and are VERY soft and fluffy on the inside).<br><br>Overall I prefer the Airfryer, it's more versatile, quieter and takes up less space. I actually wish I bought this instead of my Actifry back in the day as my Actifry suffered similar issues to others and was a real pain to clean.<br><br>NOTE: I've never made bread before in my LIFE so this was my first attempt, the cakes I made were also my first attempt in the Airfryer (I've previously made them in the oven)."
"Straight out of the box a very quick read of the instructions & it was obvious this is simplicity itself to use.<br><br>Have now cooked both frozen chips & freshly cut potato chops both of which were cooked for the recommended times with excellent results. The chips taste slightly different from deep fat fried chips but very nice none the less<br><br>One quick tip - Soak fresh cut chips for 5 mins prior to cooking as otherwise the odd chip will be a little undercooked<br><br>After use it is so simple to clean - Just remove the drawer with the basket & then  remove the basket from the drawer<br><br>All in all this is brilliant and so much cleaner than the almost now defunct deep fat chip fryer"
"Some varied reviews made me unsure whether to purchase but I went ahead and I love it! I don't like oven chips which are oven cooked but in the air fryer they cook really well, whether frozen or fresh. I haven't cooked anything else yet but I'm confident it will do the job just as well."
"Bought one last year and as always with premium goods I felt disapointed to find it was manufactured in china, put together for a few dollars by slave workers then shipped half way across the world.<br><br>Slightly disappointed that the timer is mechanical and not electronic. It could be a bit larger although it takes up a large amount of space in the dish washer.<br><br>I use it virtually everyday and it makes delicious chips, chicken, bacon, sausages and other food.<br><br>My tip to other users is after about 10 minutes to use a spashula to properly mix the chips up and then again a couple of times after that depends on how many chips your making.<br><br>The inside of the pan started to peel but Philips replaced the pan with no fuss."
"This is great. Very easy to use and cooks well. Simple dial to set temperature and another for the time. A little noisy and somewhat bulky but it does the job so no complaints.<br><br>UPDATE 6 weeks later. Leaves a bit of a smell in the area it is used so have moved to utility room as it was setting off smoke alarms in the kitchen. Is thoroughly cleaned before and after use so it's not like we are recycling the fat the comes off the previously used product."
"As some reviews suggested it is quite large. Apart for that its so far so good. It makes all the items I purchased it for. Its now time to see what else it will do. Well worth the discounted price.  Philips is a Quality brand also, so I expect many years of hassle free cooking. Very easy and quick to clean also."
"I just love this....I use it for all kinds of potatoes including roasties on a Sunday....ok not quite as good as those you cook in goose fat but quite acceptable for a normal Sunday! I cook chicken breasts and use the recipe booklet for mixed veggies. It's a bit big to store in s cupboard but as it looks good, I keep mine in the utility room & just take it into the kitchen for use."
"Best purchase ever.  Makes delicious crispy on the outside, powdery on the inside chips. Potato coquettes are a treat done in the airfryer. Recommend to anyone. Great buy ."
"Great for the price (under £80). Really easy to use and great results so far, with homemade chips, oven chips, wedges and re-heating our christmas roast potatoes. Great results all round."
"Brilliant little machine. Does what it says uses hot air requires no oil what so ever. Very happy.<br>A very good way to help you stick to your new years resolution."
"Bought this for my mum for christmas and well..... she is raving about it ever since<br>The healthiest chips our family have had in year !!!<br>This product was recommended to me by a good friend and it was the best buy I have made for many years ,thank you K&K<br>Easy to use, simple instructions.<br>It makes more than just chips so that is a bonus<br>Its quite a large item, mine sits proudly on the work top<br>The chips taste much better than the deep fat fried ones, probably because I know it is better for our family<br>Easy to Clean which is a plus<br>Would recommend to anyone.<br>Great price and Super fast delivery<br>Congrats Amazon as always"
"It arrived very quickly, soon as I had clean the fryer I tried it out just with a few chips to see how it worked this was ok nice crispy chips soft in middle, so thought chips for dinner for two but this time with it full basket  to the mark set 180 , 33 mins  also shanked half way though cooking time but was disported when I open up to see they were not crispy and over half still soft  had to put on for a farther 15 mins ,now I will only cook just few chips at a time not as good as my telf fryer"
"Just bought this and found it bigger than i thought, but very stylish.  I tried fresh potato chips but were not that impressed.. they were not crispy at all, then i tried frozen chips (not oven chips) the frying type ,  and they are the best just a spoonful of Rapseed oil<br>and they were crispy and golden and lovely.  Highly recommend this machine and the recipe book that comes with it is very useful.....gives some great ideas."
"I was slightly sceptical about this product, it's really a miniature fan oven but it works incredibly well, and all the residual fat in the base is a testament to how little you eat. Fiddly to clean and drainer seems a bit cheaply made from expanded metal<br><br>The documentation and instructions were pretty poor and it does not explain the product or even have a dedicated website to help you. You would not have thought that this came from the same company as Hue.<br><br>Packaging and delivery good."
"The airfrier is absolutely amazing! we have used it for chips, sausages, sausage rolls, chicken everything. gives your meat a nice crispy coating without the need to deep fry them. It can be used for anything that you would put in the oven and it takes less time to cook.<br><br>The only downfall is the noise it makes which is not too bad but can be quit loud.<br><br>It is easy to clean too"
"This is the third Phillips Airfrier I've purchased...I've been singing the Phillip's Aifrier's praises since I purchased my first one a couple of years ago.The other two were brought as presents for family members who were so impressed by the results of my original...they knew what they wanted for Christmas...Phillips Airfriers of their own! It's a rare occasion when I endorse a product (for free as well) but this is a must have in everyone's kitchen."
"Quite large item but basket is small so if looking to cater for larger nos the bigger size would be better. The chips are lovely and guilt free! Improving each time I've used it as get to guage heat/ chip size & style better. A good buy especially if you don't want to always say no to your childrens request for chips!"
"Good"
"Excellent would highly recommend this product although the basket is only small it is sufficient for 2 people. The chips are crispy and chicken cooks much nicer than in the oven. It is trial and error at first until you get used to using it."
"I love this! nearly had a dreadful fire when cooking chips in a conventional fryer. Threw it out immediately. Family love chips though.. Bought this, perfect chips, roast potatoes and other roast veg, fish, chicken etc brilliant. Large basket, able to cook enough chips, roats etc for 4 with no problem, very impressed So safe and easy to use without fat. Pop frozen oven chips into basket, and 16 mins later, perfect crispy chips. Easy to clean too.  Have cooked so many things including cakes, wish I'd got this years ago. Smart looking too! Love, love it.!"
"Bought one of these as we had thrown our old fryer out to lead a more healthy eating lifestyle....  What an amazing product, to be able to taste food as it should be with no greasy fat content is fantastic. Chips, roast potatoes, asparagus and even bacon cooked in it, cannot praise this product too much. If your thinking of buying one don't..... just do it... you will not be disappointed, throw your old fryer out and invest in one of these, healthy tasty food."
"I absolutely love this Airfryer...much better than I expected!! Fantastic fresh hand-cut chips. I toss the dried off chips in a large bowl and add one and a half tablespoons of oil, making sure I cover all the chips, then put them in the airfryer container for approx 25 mins, giving them a shake around about twice..result...delicious and for me, much better than deep fried chips !! Thank you so much."
"As a person who continually has to watch my weight, I've found this appliance a brilliant way to cut the calories as I don't use any oil when cooking with it.  It's great for cooking chips, burgers, reheating a single portion of quiche and so much more.  I've been so impressed with mine, that I bought one for my daughter and my son too. They are both very pleased with this great cooking device - saves time too. And I put it through the dishwasher every now and again and it's been fine."
"I love this air fryer.  It cooks quickly and thoroughly without any excess fat.  I have used it for scampi, chicken portions, fish and chips and for quickly warming up pies and pasties.  It is a bit noisy in operation but not much more than a microwave and the results are far better.  I would not be without it now."
"Love this fryer, I used more oil than needed 1st time, I use half or threequarters tablespoon now and it's fine. We are still practising as yet but very pleased with results so far. Does chicken drumsticks very well didn't use any oil on the 2nd attempt they were lovely. I would recommend this fryer."
"One of the best purchases I ever did here! It's easy to wash in the dishwasher, doesn't emmit smells as much as the other fryers I have encountered. And most of all it cooks perfect chips meatballs pastries and fish with only a pinch of oil! A \"must buy\"!"
"After a bit of experimenting I've achieved excellent results with chunky cut oven chips which taste as good as deep fried."
"i bought for whole my family Christmas present and every one love it"
"Bought this to replace Actifry which I used all the time but sadly the paddle broke on 2 occasions over 12-18 math period .<br>Sadly, I have hardly used it because my husband dislikes the chips/ roast potatoes so much as they are very dry and while we want them healthy, we want them edible too !  Hardly used. Wasted my money on this - much, prefer the  Actifry."
"After only a few months we had a problem closing the basket We persivered until last night it would not close at all Needless to say its on its way to the skip Not buy again"
"A glorified and compressed fan oven but that's what I needed for small meals etc.<br>We have now literally switched of any format of oil frying after we bought this one."
"I bought two of these as presents for family at Christmas.  I have had one myself for about three years and would not want to be without it.  It makes wonderful low fat chips,wedges and roasties.  and I crisp up my jacket potatoes after microwaving."
"sceptical order ... great new purchase , have already cooked frozen French fries (taste great and crunchy) Chinese spring rolls, samosa's, onion  bhaji's ( all piping hot and delicious) even  an  egg in small ramekin dish (perfect) and I am a man so not the best cook ,now all of these are normally done in a deep fat fryer so would expect a difference and the only one was Nothing was greasy so hey great I am converted and looking through cupboards and freezer to see what else to try"
"not as good as I was expecting"
"I got this as a Christmas present & was really dubious about it at first as I couldn't see how you could 'fry' food without oil. However, I have used it & it is great! Food turns out perfectly & is healthier too."
"fantastic product much better than deep fried foods, and oven chips taste just like deep fried instead of dry and hard from a normal oven, well done to Philips a first class product."
"This thing is amazing!!!!  Another big plus is that it doesn't stink your kitchen out like other conventional fryers.<br><br>Chips at home have never tasted so good :)  Highly recommend getting one if you're looking for a good fryer."
"this is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC - so far I have done skinny fries, hash browns, Aunt Bessies Roasties, McCains Gorgeous chips, and maris pipers from raw - all come out brilliant - less time than cooking in the oven and so fluffier inside crispy outside - and healthier than frying - 11 out of 10 for this!!!"
"only used three times received five days ago brilliant"
"A Great Machine, I cook Southern Fried Chicken in mine a lot, and it Tastes a Lot Better then KFC...  Spicy Potato Wedges lovely and healthy... Crispy Outside Fluffy inside..."
"Very pleased with it. It makes excellent potato, parsnip and pumpkin chips. Handy if you have an allotment and a bumper crop of pumpkins and parsnips! Easy to clean and no nasty cooking smells. Quite a big beast though."
"Proper chips at last - so much better to make your own.  easy to use & clean an excellent product."
"Great easy to clean.easy to use.only thing i can say is its not big enough for a family. But if your a couple great.Saves on using your main oven. Fab"
"I was sceptical to start with that these machine would make good tasting chips; but they do. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to watch their fat content but still wants chips now and then!<br><br>Pros:<br>- Frozen chips taste just as good as if done in a deep fryer.<br>- No oil needed at all with frozen chips.<br>- Better built than the Tefal Actifry. I saw one on show in Curry's about a week before and their version looked looked and felt flimsy and plastic. This is defiantly more durable to 'abuse'.<br>- Fat frozen chips take about 13 mins (altogether)<br><br>Cons:<br>- Careful not to overcook or you get over cooked oven tasting chips! Yuk.<br>- Does take longer than a deep fryer but with no/little oil needed it's worth it.<br><br>I've yet to try home-made chips but this is next on the list in the next week also."
"We dont eat much fried food,  but every so often everyone fancies something \"naughty\" and I figured this might be a healthier way of doing it.  I hadnt used one of these before, so wasnt sure what to expect, but it's a bit disappointing.  So my indifferent review is probably not directed at just this fryer, but I guess at these dry fryers in general.  I think you could probably get better results just by baking things in the oven with a little olive oil without having an additional piece of equipment.  It's OK, but whilst I couldnt say it was noisy, you're glad when you switch it off and things take longer to cook in it than implied - if you're aiming for that crunchy texture..."
"Great fryer"
"There's a reason why I'm writing a review almost 2 years after I bought it. I simply though it'd be a fad. The truth is it is not. This is now an essential machine in our home. We almost use it on a daily basis, from frying chicken and fish to heating up pitta bread. Its performance now after 2 years is the same as first use. We never use deep frying with oil at home and this little gem made it easy for us. Love it. Well-worth the money. I highly recommend it to anyone."
"Has been working amazing so far. I dont need to use oil anymore! healthier option."
"Hardly a day has gone buy that i don't use this air-fryer, its the best kitchen gizmo ever..you can literally bung anything in it.. not soup tho that would be messy, :O) anything that say takes 20 mins in an over will take about 12-13 in the air-fryer, I love to put in hot-cross buns, it toasts them to perfection. don't really do chips so i don't know about them but i do do roast potatoes and Jackets in it and they are perfection every-time. it is certainly worth the money that's a given. Get one, give it a go, you wont regret it"
"Just perfect"
"Very good product. I bought it for my mum. I already have one"
"good buy"
"After several attempts to cook chips, all unsuccessful, we returned the AirFryer. Despite following the recommended method, to the letter, and shaking and turning the chips every five minutes, and then every three minutes, the result was undercooked centres and burnt edges. Chicken took far longer than the recommended time and, just like the chips, cooked unevenly.<br><br>We were glad that we had purchased from Amazon as return, and a full refund, were handled without quibbling. We have now bought a deep fat fryer and are enjoying real French fries again."
"I was quite excited to receive my Philips Airfryer after reading the great reviews from fellow amazon buyers.<br><br>The package arrived in a timely fashion just as stated by the amazon shipping estimate.<br><br>This product is a lot cheaper on amazon than in local retailers and buying it here actually shaved off a whopping 300 DKK or approximately £ 33.2 from the price off this item compared to Danish prices which retails at 1100 DKK or 121 pounds.<br><br>On to the product itself: It arrived in a nice box with an instruction pamphlet and 2 yr warranty from Phillips! The helpful laminated quick start sheet with different frying times for chips is a nice touch and proved useful when having people unfamiliar with the product use the fryer!<br><br>Using the fryer is therefore a simple straightforward process, you put the fries (or whatever you wish to cook) into the clever pop-out tray, quickly consult the cooking time reference sheet or pamphlet for the correct amount of minutes - ensuring the perfect amount of crispness - and then set the timer. Pop the tray out and give the contents a stir about halfway through. Pop it back in and wait until perfectly golden and crisp. DONE.<br><br>Out comes deliciously crispy french fries every time !!!<br><br>I can now sate my addiction to french fries without going the unhealthy fast food route of deep frying.<br><br>One evening I had forgot to take out some steaks out of the freezer the day before in order to thaw so I ended up with deep frozen meat and guests arriving within the hour - I just popped them into the airfryer (the meat not the guests :D) and they magically turned into a delicious meal within 30 minutes! This thing is amazing.<br><br>Also I've been told it's much more energy efficient that using conventional ovens so that's another plus. Save the environment and your own Health!<br><br> Buy it now you won't look back."
"Great product, used almost exclusively for cooking frozen chips. Takes a bit if experimentation to get the right chips and definitely needs a little bit more oil than recommended but when you do get these variables right the results are excellent. I have knocked a star off because the Philips Accessories are an absolutely ridiculous price. Irrelevant if you don't want them of course but I wanted a food separator, just a little metal plate.... £20!!!"
"This is very healthy. I have used this for chicken, yam, potatoe, fish, spring roles and hard plantain. It does not good for soft plantain. I have now reduced the deep oil frying in the house. It is easy to operate. Beware- Do not allow your kids to come close to it.It is very affordabe from Europe as compared to prices in Ghana."
"I have tried so many deep fat fryers and spent a fortune over the years to find the right one. This is exactly what I have been waiting for, it takes so little oil to cook the food whereas my previous machine needed 4 litres to fill every time. The food tastes so good and chips crisp up really well, no housefull of smelly oil either. It takes a little trial and error to get the cooking times right for how you like your food cooked but the instructions are really easy to understand and Cleaning after use is so easy. I have been a member of Slimming World for the past couple of years and have always had to make my own chips in the oven while frying the rest for the family. Now I just spray the dried chips to coat them and cook everyone`s together. It could not be easier and I am so glad I got this."
"I was nervous of this product 'cos it's expensive and would I use it enough to make it good value?<br>I am very pleased with it. (We have not had a deep-fat fryer in the house for over 10 years, both for Health reasons and because they are so dirty and greasy).<br>I had bought frozen chips, both chunky and string type to be ready when it came. We had children visiting so the AirFryer was unpacked, rinsed out and plugged in within minutes of its arrival. It is so simple to use, just plug in, set the timer and walk away. It looks good too, with a shiny black easy-clean finish. The children were very impressed with their chips and at ages 11, 10 and 9 they are competent and honest critics. We went through both bags of frozen chips in the one sitting.<br>My husband normally would not think of eating chips but he loved them too.<br>It is a heavy object but I like that, it feels as if it is sturdy and has Quality and it will not get knocked over easily. You pull out the food drawer, pop in the food and close it. It says you should preheat but I don't, instead I add a minute to the cooking time as I feel the preheating is wasted when the food drawer is opened. It is not very loud - sounds like a low-powered hair dryer during cooking and a pleasant bell sounds when the food is ready.<br>Cooking times are approximate, but you MUST shake the food to turn and crisp it, we keep peeping in and tasting. I have added a couple of minutes to get the crispiness we like to the chunky chips.<br>We have it 3 weeks now and it is being used regularly. Aside from the chips and potatoes another thing we cooked in it was chicken legs. This was very brave I thought, as chicken is so dangerous if not fully cooked thru'. My son found chicken pieces in the fridge marinating in a thick sauce I'd made, and decided to have our dinner ready when we came in from work. I had intended to precook the chicken before Airfrying it, but he just lobbed it into the Airfryer and said he gave it 20 minutes and left it standing in the machine for another 10.IT WAS GORGEOUS! Really crispy and very moist AND cooked right thru'. I kept checking for 'pink bits' but there were none. The only problem was that the sauce dribbled and burnt inside the machine and took a lot of Cleaning (well ok, the dishwasher did most of it). I would recommend using less sauce, more a drier mixture to coat the chicken.<br>I have 'fried' cold leftover potatoes in it and they were great too.<br>All in all I like this product a lot and am glad I spent the money to get a really good Quality appliance."
"If you love chips, like we do, this is definitely the best bit of kit for your kitchen.  You can cut your potatoes in all shapes or just buy ready to cook ones, they all taste terrific!  So good my step daughter wanted one for Christmas after she'd tasted chips cooked in my fryer.  I bought this model based on the reviews I read about all these type of fryers, so reviews definitely influence decisions."
"Best appliance anyone can buy for their kitchen, I've had the product a year now and use it most days a week, easy enough to clean, cooks food quickly and food has that crunch on the outside, soft on the inside texture. What's not to like?"
"I was reallyt keen to buy this and was singing it's praises to everyone based on what I had heard.<br>The reality is a little different.  The device is well made and certainly easy to use and also seems well made.<br>It's also quote easy to clean except for the wire netting at the bottom.<br><br>BUT frying chips is quite dissapointing. The lack of oil is obvious in the texture of the chips and they are nothing like deep fried chips. They also take the best part of 20 minutes.<br>Frying fish balls was even more dissapointing. You might as well oven bake them for that is what this device really does.<br>Just put them on the top shelf of your turbo oven.<br>This device has a large footprint so think where you're going to store it before buying it.<br><br>I tried making boiled eggs in it (!) and it does work but you need 15-20 minutes. The skins are very hard to remove afterwards though."
"The Philips Airfryer arrived on time and well packaged. I was impressed by its looks - it's sleek and functional and looks pretty good on the kitchen counter. The retractable wire was an added bonus. The instructions are extremely easy to follow so much so that I was already cooking chips a few minutes after unpacking it. I chose this model since the basket is large enough to cook for two to three persons. Results were great at the first try - chips and roast potatoes came out perfectly golden brown, crunchy on the outside but fluffy in the centre. The chicken drumsticks came out a dream, retaining all the lovely juices. I managed to fit a small chicken which turned out better than the ready-roasted ones you get in supermarkets. I've used it for baking pies, cakes, cordon bleu, springrolls, pre-baked breads...the results were consistently good. Cleaning it was just as easy. Worth every penny!"
"Bought this as a replacement for my old deep fat fryer which I was all too happy to junk.<br><br>I chose this as an alternative to the Tefal actifry and I'm happy I did.<br>1. Takes up about the same space as my old fryer.<br>2. Doesn't produce smells that last for hours unlike the old fryer.<br>3. No waste oil to change every so often (though as expected you still have to use some on your food to help it cook), this makes this very environmentally friendly as your not having to dispose of gallons of waste oil per year into landfill.<br>4. Significantly reduces the amount of oil used to cook things, which is alot healthier option.<br>5. Easier to clean than my old fryer as it the interior is covered in a non stick coating.<br>6. Not as much room as a large rectangular deep fat fryer, but about the same amount of room as a standard one.<br>7. Easy timer guide provided so you can set things up at a glance.<br><br>Overall I'm very impressed with the Philips air fryer, it is by far a much healthier and environmentally friendly fryer. The reason I chose this rather than the Tefal is that the Tefal has this rotating thing in the middle, meaning I can't cook fish/fish fingers in it as they would break up. The Philips air fryer doesnt have this, instead it blows hot air all around your food and in such a small space cooks extremely well."
"easy to use & clean, really good for chips with minimum fat involved- would recommend"
"When I first bought this fryer, I was apprehensive it would turn out to be yet another gizmo that you buy thinking that may be great but, in the end, fails to live up to the expectations. Furthermore, it is not the smallest of items at 287 x 315 x 384 mm, so I wondered if it would be worth the hassle, not to mention the space it would take in the kitchen.<br><br>Well, I am very glad to say that was not the case and this fryer has proved to be everything it says on the box.<br>It is quite stylish, in its high-quality glossy black plastic, it is very energy efficient and, most importantly, after a short and simple (although necessary) learning curve, produces fries and everything else fried you may want to throw at it, with the same Quality you get from any other deep fat fryer... with the difference this one is virtually oil/fat free.<br>You can put freezer fries in it without any oil addition or just shake a few fresh cut ones inside a Tupperware container (or similar) with a minimal quantity of sunflower oil (or other) inside. A few shakes and they are ready to go into the fryer.<br><br>The results are superb. If you are into fried food and want to have a healthier way of having it WITHOUT compromising on taste, texture and overall Quality, this machine is for you.<br>I have since bought other ones for family as gifts."
"Got rid of my deep fat fryer and just love this.  Perfect for part-cooked bread rolls so you have 'fresh' whenever you want it.  Highly recommend this item."
"Thank you for Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black.<br>I can cook without oil now :) all sorts of food (fish, chicken, turkey, chips, potatoes, vegetables etc). The only thing is that I would have loved to receive a pot that goes inside the Airfryer as well so I could cook cakes with the Airfryer."
"Exactly what it says it is an airfryer<br>Basically this does the job of an oven, but with a super strong fan setting<br>Result: much better than oven Quality fries, nuggets, etc however, doesnt beat the real thing (deep fried in oil), healthier alternative<br><br>Cleaning the machine after use is a bit of a hassle. The mesh wire net seems to trap crumbs etc, and the fibres on dishwashing sponge keeps getting stuck on the mesh wire net. Be careful not to use anything abrasive so as not to damage the non-stick coating.<br>Other than that straightforward cleaning so 4 stars for this item.<br><br>Try cooking chips and tossing some cheese in 1 minute before its done. Easy and perfect chips and cheese!"
"I basically love french fries (chips to us English), but I found it very messy to deal with the oil. Apart from the fact that I am supposed to be careful about how much grease and calories I consume! This apparatus solves both problems and the chips really come out tasting great ! I've even managed to do something as simple as to fry an egg!"
"Excellent, produces very nice chips though a little more slowly than the traditional method. However it is neater, cleaner, requires less washing up and you don't have the problem of disposing of all tlhat oil."
"With a name like Philips you think that this would be a good idea but IT ISN'T.<br>What a palaver to make chips that don't turn out appetising!!!<br>Peel the spuds, soak for 30 mins, dry with paper towel or tea towel then add a bit of olive oil then mix in a bowl with the oil then put them in the basket to cook.<br>The end results are disappointing and I'd rather go back to my Actifry. At least they were appetising.<br><br>Don't bother with a name like Philips"
"This is my second Airfryer. The first went straight to my daughter after a short trial period. Homemade chips are much better than in the Tefal Actifry, which I discarded, after first the paddle broke, then the lid and, after 2 years of use the part of connecting the lid to the main body practically disintegrated, and replacements are quite costly.<br>While I love chips I didn't want to deep-fry with all the hussle involved, the smell and having to get rid of the used oil.<br>After a few experiments the chips came out perfect. I recommend starting with a lower temperature, say 160°C, then upping it to 200°C for the remaining time.<br>Well, in the meantime I've gone low-carb, and here again the Airfryer comes in handy. Chicken wings, drumsticks or thighs, tossed in spices and a little oil, turn out great, as a matter of fact much better than in the oven. I had tried to make them in the actifry as well, but the coating came off, burning in the hot fat, which collected in the bottom of the pan, and the results were not in the least appealing.<br>I truly recommend this gadget, especially for a household of 1 or 2!"
"I rarely do reviews but I'm very pleased to have spent £160 on this little thing. Yes, it's nothing more than a small fan assisted oven BUT it works very well. Heats up instantly, no smells, easy clean and the food cooks very evenly.  Surprise is chips (fries!) - I was sceptical but 22 minutes in this thing and my freshly chopped potatoes came out as crispy outside, fluffy inside chips - all without oil. A microwave does not do that...<br>Maybe not much use to a large family but to the wife and I it's become a daily use and I'm sure less of a drain on the energy bill than the oven.<br>Recommended - build quality seems high too."
"was a bit sceptical about this, and so really looking forward to trying it out. out of the box, is quite large (medicine ball sized), in shiney black plastic. not unattractive, but personally wouldnt want to leave out on the side.<br>VERY easy to use. made 2 batches of chips from scratch on the 1st day. cut the chips, wash and dry, mix with a dash of oil. then pop them in the basket, set the temp to 200deg and the timer to 15 mins. one shake half way through. it's that simple. don't even need to wait for it to heat up.<br>have tried thick cut chips and french fries - both were amazing. crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. very tasty and hugely better than oven chips. equally as nice as proper chips cooked in fat. and with only a teaspoon of oil or so, these really are significantly better for you.<br>a quick wipe on the inside, and then the basket goes in the dishwasher, so easy to clean.<br>best of all, no chip-fat smell whatsoever.<br>AND the kids loved the chips - always a hard audience to please!<br>can't wait to try it out on other types of food - fried chicken, samosas, etc..<br>really cannot overstate how impressed I am with this. time to ditch the traditional deep-fat fryer."
"I was very dubious about this product and the claims it made before I received it.  I mean, the very practice of frying is hardly healthy now is it.  Hence the reason I've never owned any sort of fat fryer and only occasionally shallow fry food.  However, I was drawn to the fact that this is an 'air fryer', a technology that superheats air and allows the use of minimal amounts of oil or even none at all.<br><br>On receiving the Airfryer I was surprised at the size.  It isn't exactly small and it is a reasonable weight as well.  What I was very impressed with was the build quality.  The thing looks very swish in the corner of the kitchen, black and chic as if it will transform your chips into modern art pieces.  And taste wise I found it wasn't too far off!  But I digress.  Set up was easy and very well laid out in the easy start guide provided with the fryer.  The whole thing was out of the box, washed and set up ready for use in less than 20 minutes.<br><br>My first foray into airfrying was actually not chips but some chinese wonton dumplings that had been sitting in the freezer for some time.  Now the instructions on the packet were to fry them from frozen for 12 minutes, and after consulting the guide with the fryer that tied in with the time given for spring rolls which I deemed to be of similar construction and density.  So I pre-heated the airfryer for a few minutes and then popped the food in the basket.  Gave them a quick shake halfway through and then at the end of cooking I was presented with perfectly cooked, crisp and golden pork wonton.  Really nicely cooked and completely hassle free.<br><br>I have cooked self made chips, oven chips and self made potatoe cubes in the airfryer and all came out perfectly.  The oven chips I cooked at the same time as a pork steak I had marinaded, thanks to the handy metal divider that can be placed into the basket to cook separate foodstuffs at the same time.  The pork was cooked really well, not dried out and maintaining all the flavour I expected.  The oven chips were good too but it was the self made chips and cubes that were a revelation.  The instructions suggested using a teaspoon of oil on potatoes to prevent drying out but I decided a couple of sprays of the '1 cal' oil and a bit of garlic for seasoning would do the trick.  And it did.  Both chips and cubes tasted fantastic, no grease and all taste.  Much better than ovenchips.<br><br>On a practical level the airfryer is great.  The bottom section is the 'drawer' that pulls out and contains the food basket.  The main body of the thing houses the fans and heater etc.  It creates no smell at all when cooking, so no unpleasant oily odours and such.  The basket section is completely washable and even dishwashable (though I don't have one).  I've found it very easy to cook the stuff and then dump the whole basket and food drawer section straight into a bowl of soapy warm water.  When I come back it is a very simple matter to clean the thing and leave it to drain ready for more use.  The main body can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth.  I've been very impressed with how robust and easy this equipment is, I was expecting something far more fiddly to use.<br><br>Other points of interest are a nice 2 year guarantee and a nice book of 30 Recipes that has some good recipe ideas.<br><br>I've been very impressed with this piece of equipment.  It isn't cheap but it is extremely good at giving results that taste great and cause a minimum of fuss.  I suspect this airfryer will become a very much valued part of my kitchen armoury from now on."
"Packaging<br>The Airfryer comes well packaged in a large, sturdy box.<br><br>Installation<br>The instructions for installing are printed in a booklet and are very easy to follow.<br><br>Ease of use<br>The Airfryer is very easy to use.  The timer setting knob is not easy to set precisely but this doesn't matter as it is not necessary to time the cooking to more than plus or minus a minute anyway. The temperature setting knob is again not designed to be 100% precise as it just isn't necessary.  I did find the basket and it's casing to be a little on the heavy side, however, this isn't too much of a problem as once you've got the whole thing slid out you can release the basket and just use that.  One thing I was surprised at was how quiet the appliance is when cooking, I was expecting it to sound like a jet engine but it is more of a quiet hum or whirr.  cleaning, while not hard, can be annoying.  For example, when I tried to scrub the basket bottom the mesh ended up covered in little pieces of the washing up sponge.  This isn't a problem if you have a dish washer, but for those of us who haven't it can get frustrating.<br><br>Results<br>We tried cooking a few different things in it and overall were pleased with the results.  Things such as pre-packaged chicken in breadcrumb (nuggets and fillets) came out wonderfully crisp with a tender more succulent inside and much less fatty than when ovened or grilled.  Oven chips while still tasting like cardboard oven chips were still better than when cooked in a conventional oven and again less greasy.  Real fresh chips took us a while to get the hang of.  We originally tried using all purpose potatoes and 1 cal oil spray but they came out undercooked in places and not very nice.  However, once we swapped to Maris Piper potatoes and Sunflower oil they came out lovely.  I would recommend cooking in shorter bursts with plenty of shaking/mixing to ensure they cook evenly.<br><br>Conclusion<br>All in all the Airfryer was a pleasant surprise.  It worked well and was easy to use which is great for me as I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination.  The food all comes out a lot less fatty than when cooked in other ways which is very healthy and will be great for my husband who has diabetes and has to keep his fat intake down.  Although the price is high, it is certainly worth investing in.<br><br>Note:<br>I do have one concern however, there is no Safety cut-out when the basket and protective casing is pulled out.  The Airfryer keeps on going with its heating elements exposed so do not let the children near it unsupervised.<br><br>UPDATE<br>======<br>It's now 12/03/2012 and the timer has all but stopped working making it far to dangerous to use, so a point off for longevity!"
"My sister was sooooooo envious when I got this.<br><br>I have no idea why.<br><br>Its basically a very small electric oven, so small that the cooking area is (not coincidentally) about the same size as a chip pan, and she already has one of those.<br><br>Cooking in it is the same as cooking in an oven.  None of the Recipes in the booklet that comes with it can't be done in an oven.  Having said that, croquettes come up a treat in it!<br><br>It's also very, very easy to clean.<br><br>So, if you have the space and the money to spare and really, really would prefer using a squat black tub to using your oven, go for it.  Otherwise, you'll regret it and it will end up by the footspa."
"I was lucky enough to receive the Phillips AirFryer from the Amazon Vine programme.  It was something that I fancied trying but would probably never have bought for myself, so this was ideal for me.  I think the price is a little high unless you are a serious fryer, but that is down to personal choice.<br><br>I hadn't used a fryer for a long time as they were always messy and difficult to clean.  The Airfryer is so simple to clean, as the pull-out drawer has a detachable basket so it can all be washed very easily and quickly.<br><br>I have cooked a few lots of chips in it, which come out great, although I think it will take a bit of practice to get it right every time, and it does depend on the potatoes that you use.  Another reviewer suggested Maris Pipers are the best to use and I'd agree with that.<br><br>I've also cooked rostis in it, using the recipe from the booklet that comes with it.  They came out really well, and I'd definitely try some more of the Recipes.  Chicken nuggets and fish fingers came out well in the fryer too and were not greasy at all.<br><br>Because there is so little oil used it mostly evaporates with the heat and this helps to keep it clean.  All it really needs after use is a wipe down.  I think if you were to put too much oil in then over time the mesh in the basket could get a bit greasy, but the basket is easily removed so it's no problem to soak it to get it properly clean.<br><br>The timer is a basic dial type, which are never very accurate and it's quite awkward to reduce the time to less if you set it for a bit too long.  For the price, I think a digital timer and a better alarm would have been good but it's not a problem as you can always set the timer higher and use another timer to tell you when they are done and just stop it when you've had things in for long enough.<br><br>Because you're not frying in oil, it's so easy to just pull out the tray to shake the food to help it cook evenly without worrying about it splashing everywhere, and the fryer just keeps on going so you just put the drawer back in and it carries on with the cooking process.<br><br>On the subject of oil, the instructions state that olive oil should be used to coat the potatoes, and I have found that is a lot better than vegetable oil (as mentioned by another reviewer).  This could depend on what you are cooking and practice, but for basic chips it seems the best option.<br><br>It's a reasonably weighty product, but it's well-balanced as the motor is in the top of the fryer.  It's easy to lift and move around.  It also looks nice as it has a good shape and a sleek black casing.<br><br>In summary, I have found this an easy product to use, that gives you great, non-greasy food and looks good."
"There are only two controls on this device, a thermostat and a timer. So far  the results for fresh chips have been very dis-appointing.<br><br>I used Maris Piper potatoes, coated in vegetable oil, warmed the machine up for 3 mins then cooked the chips for13 mins at 190 deg C. Shook the basket halfway through. The results were - some nice chips, but probably a third were soggy potato.<br><br>Will keep on trying but first results do not bode well<br><br>Update: Better results with two 10 minute sessions, and a good shake in between. Chopped the potatoes and soaked in salt water, patted them dry prior to cooking"
"I bought this to replace an \"Actifry\" which was excellent but suddenly packed up after about 2 ½ years when the element blew.  The Airfryer has a 2 year guarantee which gives a degree of confidence however if there are any reliability issues I will update this review.<br>This is a low fat fryer which relies on hot air for cooking, much safer than a deep fat frying, the food to be cooked is placed in a basket (which can be divided in two to separate two different types of food and even take a 7\" dish although taking it out of the basket is not the easiest of tasks) the temperature and time is set and that is it except that halfway through the basket has to be removed and shaken, this is particularly important with chips which will stick together if not shaken. The cooked food was excellent, chips cooking well and fast<br>Both the Airfryer and the Actifry do similar things in a similar manner but there are some detailed differences.<br>The Airfryer has a smaller workplace footprint although taller than the Actifry, is quieter (still with a fairly noisy fan) and cooks quicker. Also the Airfryer does not have a paddle which rotates and can damage delicate foods and is easier to clean.<br>The Actifry does however have one other advantage other than cost in that you can see the food being cooked.<br>UPDATE I still like it but the mechanical timer sometimes sticks or rather does not start, if you hear it ticking it is going to be OK.<br>UPDATE 24/03/11<br>It is being advertised on one of the shopping channels at the moment and they show cooking sausages although I am sure this works it advises against sausages and other high fat items in the instruction book, it does not give a reason but I assume that it is to prevent fat splashing on the heating element. Use caution if you wish to cook sausages, I have not tried them in the AirFryer.<br>UPDATE 25/10/11<br>The cord got jammed in the base and I had to take it off to pull the cord out. (Only two screws but be careful not to break off the plastic tags.<br>It is poor Design as the cord is only fed into a void, no spool or anything, and if it kinks there is no way of pulling it out without dismantling it.<br>UPDATE 27/11/13<br>Still going well no problems.<br>UPDATE 29/11/13<br>Please note if this is not big enough for you there is now a bigger one.<br>Philips HD9240/90 Avance Collection Airfryer Extra-Large, 3 Litre, 2100 Watt, Black"
"What a brilliant machine - part fryer, part oven - even my husband loves to cook with this!!!!<br>The AirFryer heats up to temperature in a few minutes and acts like a fryer or an oven depending upon your needs.<br><br>One piece of advice... do not go back to oven chips - make your own wedges or chips from REAL potatoes - this Airfryer cooks them a treat!!!!<br><br>The Air Fryer was well worth the money paid for it!"
"First of all this thing is HUGE, if I'd known it was going to be almost as big as my oven then I would have just bought a new oven tray instead. Aside from the back breaking box and phenomenal amounts of packaging, there is nowhere to store it, it now sits somewhat proudly on my kitchen top as it is too bulky for any of my cupboards.<br><br>The other thing I didn't appreciate was the poor design, when you remove the frying drawer, there is a small button you press with your thumb: this releases the entire draw and leaves you with just the basket in your hand. Luckily I did this with the new, cold machine and not after I had heated it as it could easily have dropped a heavy, hot piece of metal on me. I hurt my finger and was very surprised. I would say that is a pretty flawed design feature and somewhat dangerous if you are letting children or others use the machine without supervision.<br><br>Overall, I don't think the machine is worth the price or the kitchen top position, only buy if you have ample room in your kitchen, and if you aren't tempted to press quick release buttons whilst carrying hot objects."
"I am writing this review at a time when i hear of fatalities of a house fire caused by a chip pan. This product will create you healthier chips in a safer environment. The problem is that the chips are thinner, take twice as long to cook as it states on the packaging to and don't taste as nice."
"I purchased the Philips Airfryer to replace a broken Tefal Actifry.<br><br>From the start I was disappointed with the Airfyer.  Despite carefully following the instructions for making chips (wash them/dry them/half a tablespoon of oil/shake mid cook) the chips came out unevenly cooked. The Actifry has a paddle to turn the chips during the cooking period.  Unfortunately, the Airfryer does not and this appears to be the root of the problem.<br><br>Philips sold the Airfryer with a 60 day money back guarantee.  I took advantage of this guarantee and purchased another Actifry at half the cost!"
"Bought from Amazon at close to its then full RRP of £300, this was a considered purchase and promised a considerable saving on oil, and Health benefits, in comparison to a deep fat fryer. In that respect it is quite similar to a Tefal product that I had once considered purchasing, other than learning of its reported problems. Both fryers require about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil, but where the Tefal requires that the oil be added to the fryer, the Philips requires that the food be either tossed in or brushed with oil before placing in the fryer. It does not require a great deal of surface space to use, but it is quite tall and storage in most cupboards could be an issue. No dust cover is provided or offered so worktop storage could be problematic. It is quite noisy in  use, due to the fan, but the timer is the clockwork type that emits a 'ding' when finished. Unless you are in quite close vicinity, or there is little background noise either from a TV, radio or the kids, you may not hear it. A digital timer with a more pronounced warning, would at this price break, have made rather more sense.<br><br>I had used a variety of electric fryers since experiencing an oil fire in a traditional fryer some years ago. Some lasted for 3-5 years, others rather less but none were in the same price league as this. It relies on a fan to draw in air from the top and pass it over an element not unlike that found in older electric kettles. The pan has a shaped segment in its base that is supposed to swirl the air around and to pass it back up through the food, cooking the food more or less evenly on both sides. It works to some extent but is far from perfect. If there is a single layer of something, it can perform quite well, but if there are multiple layers as with chips then it basically fails for reasons explained below,<br><br>The promises are many but performance in most cases fell rather short. When cooking chips, not the oven-ready type, despite cooking for the recommended time or more, shaking the contents as recommended after about 60% and again at about 80% of the time has elapsed, most were invariably still either mostly white or were browned only in a few places. However, it was often the case that corners were burned even though much of the chip looked uncooked. Sometimes, a few were still quite raw in places and the flavour and texture is quite different and may need time to be accepted. The only effective way to ensure even cooking is to turn each chip over so that its least cooked surfaces are nearer to the element - not the most time-efficient or practical solution. As most buyers will probably consider this as a chip fryer and nothing more, it is not ideal for the job. At its current price, even after Amazon reduced their prices by over 1/3 despite a rise in VAT, it is not the most cost-effective or simply the most effective solution. It is also seems rather slow; for example chips require about 12-15 minutes plus 3 minutes more to preheat which is about twice as long as in a deep fryer although the oil will need some time to heat. Steaks require about 10-12 minutes plus preheating time compared with about 3 or 4 in an electric grill, although the latter will need to be heated before use.<br><br>When cooking other things, like potato cakes - a family favourite - they cooked quite well if turned at about 2/3 of the time required. I did not use it with steaks or fish as I have a grill that I use for that purpose, but it was a consideration for the future. I have in the past made my own doughnuts and other fried confections and I purchased the AirFryer without any consideration that I would no longer be able to use it for that purpose. It is not suited for that type of cooking. I also often make my own crisps or game chips when entertaining and I doubt that this machine would be capable of doing that either. It is not therefore the complete solution for all domestic frying needs and you may also need a deep fat fryer for those jobs that the AirFryer is not best suited. If that is the case, why have two fryers when one will suffice?<br><br>However, after about 3-4 weeks' of use - about 8-10 uses in total, I noticed flecks of soft black plastic sticking to the metal base protector/heat reflector that is located under the pan and basket assembly. When washing the pan when last used, I noticed that its rubber feet had disintegrated such that about half of each was now missing! Having owned the item for less than 6 weeks, that is a major failing.<br><br>In consequence of its problems and failings I have had no option but to return it to Amazon for a refund. A replacement with another identical unit was not even considered.<br><br>The bottom line is that if it is a deep fryer that you need, you can buy better at a fraction of the price. If you need to cook steaks, fish, sausages etc, you can also buy an electric grill as well as a deep fryer and still save money. Between the two, there are many more jobs that they will undertake than this product can manage.<br><br>In brief, it does not perform well, is over-expensive, not fully featured and less than well designed. For its performance, it is not worth the price paid and cannot therefore be recommended unless you are a gadget hound who does not need it to cook the food it is supposedly designed to cook. As others have said, although not necessarily for the same reasons, DO NOT BUY IT!"
"I AN DIABETIC WITH A HEART CONDITION & MY WIFE HAS USED THIS NEARLY EVERY OTHER DAY SINCE WE BOUGHT IT. FOOD IS MORE TASTY, COOKS ALL ROUND EVENLY,IS QUICKER THAN OTHER COOKERS, eg HALOGEN OVEN & FREE OF FAT.I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY FOODS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DAMAGING TO MY Health. ALSO A REASONABLE price."
"As has been mentioned by others, this will not allow you to do anything that cannot be done with a grill or an oven. It is BIG, black, and expensive, most people will not have a cupboard large enough to put it away, so will have it on display. Those are all negative points. However after having several deep fat fryers over the years I have found, without exception, that they are mucky greasy things that need a lot of Cleaning. The air fryer can do all that the others can do, and more, whilst remaining clean and very economical with oil, the tray and basket can be washed by any means, and there is no oil to filter, wonder if you can do another fry in, or dispose of. If you have the money and the space it is worth looking at, there is a sixty day return option, so there is little to loose."
"The device its self looks superb and would not be an eyesore on the kitchen surface, however its performance leaves much to be desired. I was looking forward to having chips with less fat but the chips were not evenly cooked, very dry tasting and lacked the crispness found by deep fat frying. I tried several times with different settings but the result was the same each time. I will stick with the less healthy but much better tasting deep fried alternative."
"After reading a couple of reviews I was expecting  a heavy large fryer which was going to be a job to unpack and lift. It was nether heavy or hard to remove from the box.<br><br>The fryer is an impressive looking piece of equipment, similar size to a normal chip fat fryer.<br><br>The philips has a pull out selection that the food you want to cook goes in to, there is a divider so you can cook two things with out the cross contamination.<br><br>It comes with a receipt book which is very helpful as it shows you different methods for using the fryer.<br><br>First thing we tried was chips as they are the perfect bench mark to show how good it is.<br><br>To cook the chips you first have to make sure they a washed and then dried. You then place them in to a bowl with a half table spoon of vegetable oil, using you fingers or spoon mix the chips so they are covered with the oil, then you set the fryer to high and turn the dial to approximately 20 minutes, the fryer then quietly cooks them, you need to give them a shake half way through, we set the timer to 10 minutes then a bell sounds so you know to shake, then we did set it for the next 10 minutes.<br>Results were very impressive, the chips were evenly cooked, and just the right crispness, they reminded me a little of oven chips as you don't get any soaked in fat.<br><br>The best thing is the fryer was still very clean afterwards, no fat to get rid of.<br><br>I am a vegetarian so will not be cooking meat in it, but the cook book does show you how.<br><br>You can also cook frozen chips if you prefer, these cook much quicker.<br><br>I am very impressed and equally pleased with the Air-fryer.<br><br>A great product from a company that makes Quality items that do what they say they will."
"First of all, and as others have pointed out, this is not a fryer. Frying is the process of cooking in fat or oil in a pan or griddle; the Philips Airfryer is a hot air oven. That is relevant to some of the poor results reported by other reviewers. If any part of the food is shielded from the blast of hot air it is not going to be cooked. With chips in particular, loading the basket more than about half-full makes even cooking difficuly to ensure, and the recommended shake halfway through cooking does not do the job. Especially with thin fries, it is better to interrupt cooking at least twice and turn the food over with a spatula.<br><br>In this household thin oven fries are usually cooked on a George Foreman grill, with fairly crispy and delicious results and with most of the fat collected in the drip tray. It does not seem to me that the Philips Airfryer does a better job, but nor does it do a worse job. Because we do not actually own a deep fryer, and have not done for many years, there are no super-fatty fries for the Airfryer to save us from.<br><br>Considered as an oven, the Airfryer is both fast and versatile. The timings given in the recipe book are suspect, leading to a certain amount of experimentation, and I think it would be huge advantage if there was a window so food could be observed during cooking. The appliance looks somewhat like a motorcycle helmet, and the transparent visor is sorely missed. However, in the short time the tall Philips has sat on our worktop it has cooked items as diverse as fishcakes and parsnips (love 'em) succesfully and quicker than a conventional oven would do. I believe the shorter warm-up and cooking times mean it is more energy-efficient as well.<br><br>This is a tough product to summarise. Any home with a full complement of kitchen appliances probably does not need it, and it's an awkward height to find storage for. It would make an impressive gift, but I'll never get it back in the packing."

If you watch the video, that was when I had only just used it so you will see what I mean when I said I struggled a bit, however now I have done it a few times I am not having that problem any more, so if you end up struggling also, be patient and you will pick up the technique pretty fast.<br><br>Using the AirFryer is actually really easy, most things do not require oil, but some still do although a very small amount ie. wedges require half a teaspoon, I personally used sunflower oil.  Some foods you may want to experiment with timings etc.. however I used the exact instructions to cook myself some potato wedges and it cooked them perfectly, they tasted great and seemed.... fresh and healthy, no grease on them at all.<br><br>My favourite thing about this AirFryer is that it has a timer that will cut off the heat when it reaches '0', this is great as I'm easily distracted and often burn my food.  Please note that when cooking, if the AirFryer is being used from cold make sure you add 3 minutes to the timer to let it \"pre-heat\".<br><br>As for Cleaning, it's really easy, just pull the main compartment out then either put it in the dishwasher or a quick scrub will do, just make sure it's cooled down first as it can get extremely hot.<br><br>Overall I'm really pleased with this product, it's easy to use, cooks really well and it's healthy & cleaner. so top marks from me!"
"I had been looking at the Tefal Actifry for some time but didn't like the idea of the food being moved around all of the time as I thought soft food would maybe break up, I then seen the Philips AirFryer. It is the best thing since sliced bread.  does everything it says it does.  I have tried battered fish, chips, scampi, spring rolls, onion bahji, fish cakes, pizza, scampi, onion rings, Quiche, potatoe crouquettes, chicken breast and everything has been absolutely delicious. Much quicker than cooking in the oven.  the only downside is that the basket is not big enough,  although it does do enough chips for 3 adults, however when doing things like pizza baguettes it can only take 1 at a time. I would fully recommend anyone who things this is a gimmick to get it and try it. It is wonderful."
"I'll try and put this in as simple terms as possible, as I like things to be set out clearly when I'm looking for a product.<br><br>PROS:<br>- Brilliantly packaged with every type of cardboard protection known to man. There's no way this is getting broken in the post.<br>- Very sleek, shiny and cool-looking if you have a modern style kitchen.<br>- easy to use. Seriously, any idiot can do it. There's a quick start guide that'll have you up and frying in no time.<br>- The food tastes awesome. Not greasy, not dry, just great.<br>- You can cook pretty much anything in it, from cheese-filled peppers to garlic mushrooms to classic sausages and chips.<br>- The tray divider is a great idea and lets you cook two different parts to a meal, or indeed two different meals if you have fussy children, without one food getting contaminated with the taste of another.<br>- It's healthy! As healthy as frying gets. It's fantastic to be able to cook all these foods without adding oil. And even though they advise half a tablespoon of oil with homemade chips, try using just a couple of sprays of frylight 1-calorie oil and you should be fine.<br>- The recipe book that comes with it has some nice ideas and unusually it also includes the calories and fat for each recipe, which is fantastic news.<br><br>CONS:<br>- It's BIG. And HEAVY. It takes up a lot of worktop space, and if you decide to keep it in a cupboard instead, you'll most likely need someone with decent muscles to take it in and out.<br>- It's BLACK. Which may look fine in modern style kitchens but it looks very out of place in my nice white country-style kitchen. White or silver or cream options would be useful.<br>- The recipe book is filled with quite a few things that I think not many people would eat, and could do with Recipes for southern fried chicken and doughnuts. I think they'd be more useful than some of the random things in the book.<br>- There is another popular fryer that does the same job and it's a bit cheaper.<br><br>So there are a few things that could be improved on with this, but all in all I'd say it's a fab product and if you're considering buying it then go ahead!"
"The first thing you notice when opening the box is the badly thought out packaging.  The unit is quite heavy, but instead of having the protective packaging top and bottom, so you can lift the moulded packaging out then have both hands free for the machine, the packaging is on either side of the machine, so you have to lift the machine, guide the packaging and try and remove it all with only two hands.<br><br>The machine itself looks quite nice in piano black (which surprisingly didn't show every finger mark) and seems made of sturdy materials.  Some people have reported issues with the basket release button when trying to remove from the machine, but I didn't have any problems, I found the button to be easy to access, but without any risk of accidental pressing.<br><br>The instructions were relatively clear with a nice recipe book for ideas and cooking times.<br><br>In use, the fan inside to circulate the hot air was quite loud, it was certainly louder than our 18-year old fan oven, so don't expect silent usage.<br><br>I tried several frozen items, such as breaded chicken fillets, oven chips and the likes and they all came out nice and crisp, golden and tasty, in the main nicer than in the oven as they weren't as dry.<br><br>Unfortunately the couple of attempts with home-made chips had the opposite effect.  The chips were partly raw in places, even after some experimenting with cooking times/temperatures, and the parts that were cooked were more dried and heading towards burnt than in any way crisp and golden.<br><br>I also had a faulty seal and contacted Philips who took two days to send me a reply, which was cut and pasted directly from the instruction booklet and didn't have anything to do with the fault.<br><br>In all, for the price and poor customer service from Philips and the poor cooking results it's one to avoid unless you only want to cook frozen processed foods.<br><br>EDIT<br><br>After a further week Philips finally replied to tell me that the hot air/steam may come out of the top of the unit and not through the filter, making the whole concept of a filter to remove cooking smells completely useless and irrelevant, whilst also causing me to reduce the two star rating to only one star."
"I used this for the first time last night.  I was bowled over by it.  I was not expecting much as things like this often turn out to be gimicks but...<br><br>Firstly, this arrived in the MOST ENORMOUS deliver box from Amazon.  I struggled to get it through the door at work and then had to sit with it taking up half my room all afternoon.  It just about squeezed into the car.  The Philips box inside was a little smaller and the actual Airfryer was smaller still.  A bit unnecessary.<br><br>It is quite a heavy thing and the one complaint was that the actual cooking basket is relatively small.  It did 2 large portions of chips for me and my wife but we would struggle to feed the kids too.  That was an 800g batch - the recommended max although I could have put a few more in.<br><br>The process is simple.  Just cut the potatoes after peeling.  add a small slosh of oil and coat the chips.  Pour them into the Airfryer having preheated for 3 minutes.  Shake after 9 minutes and leave for another 9 minutes.  Then perfect chips.  Not greasy but crispy but really tasty chips.  You could actually taste the potato unlike with floury oven chips.  I was really pleased.<br><br>Cleaning consisted of bunging the tray and net into the dishwasher - takes up quite a lot of room and that's it.  The outside of the machine did not get at all dirty.  There was a faint smell of cooking but no smell of chip oil.  The unit is quite noisy but not bad enough to disturb.<br><br>So, this was great.  I am looking forward to cooking spring rolls next.  The recipe book does all sorts including fish fingers (home made) etc.  The separator allows you to cook 2 individual items at the same time.  The only down side is that the cooking area is not quite big enough.<br><br>I am not sure if this will turn out to be value for the quite large price tag but I am very pleased with this and recommend it thoroughly."
"This is a big, shiny black unit approx 28cm by 34cm and 32cm high. It consists of a chip-basket and drawer with an electric element and fan above it, all controlled by a thermostat and clockwork timer. It takes up quite a space on the work-top and if you move it it has a tendency to leave the feet behind.<br>You do get a recipe book with 30 Recipes, including brownies, but you can't cook anything greasy, like sausages, in it. I experimented making chips, I used fresh and frozen ones, and I found that you always needed to add some oil; frozen chips are coated with oil to stop them sticking together but it didn't seem to be enough. I also found that you needed to shake them more than the recommended once otherwise they were cooked unevenly. The chip-basket unclips from the drawer to allow you to shake the contents; the drawer has silicone feet to allow it to sit on a normal worktop. The chip-basket and drawer can be put in a dishwasher.  Results were OK but really no different to cooking oven-chips in the oven(it is a fan oven). Philips claim there are \"no nasty frying odours\", they may not be \"nasty\" but there were odours and the unit is noisy, noisier, for example, than a typical microwave oven.<br>There is a divider for the chip-basket, however when I tried to cook some chicken-drumsticks and chips together I found I couldn't shake the chips and when I tipped the basket out at the end, the divider, which is heavy metal, fell out, luckily not smashing the plate!  The AirFryer did however cook the frozen chicken drumsticks very well.<br>Philips state that snacks that can be prepared in an oven can be prepared in the AirFryer; you can even bake a cake provided the cake-tin fits in the chip-basket.<br>Philips currently offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, you get your money back if you are not satisfied. It also comes with a 2 year guarantee."
"This is a good looking kitchen gadget, better than the Tefal version.  However it does take much longer to cook chips than indicated in the booklet.  I like the fact that little oil is used but the taste of the chips/other food is slightly different to what you would expect."
"I was looking for a deep fat fryer, but was put off by the fact they are unhealthy and hard to clean. So when I saw this I thought it might be a good alternative.<br>It is very solidily made, quite heavy to lift and about half the size my microwave, so fits ok into my medium sized kitchen.<br>It looks ver smart , in lovely black coating, which looks chic and is easy to clean. People tend to gravitate towards it when the arrive in my kithen, because it looks so cool.<br><br>As for performance, the first thing I like about it is its so easy to use and quick. It is about a third ( sometimes half ) the cooking time normal. I was disappointed at first as I thought it would not give a deep fried taste, as it seems to me to work more like a high powered air oven. With air being circulated through the cooker at a high speed to cook food. However the results so far have been delicious, and people have commented how tasty the food is.<br>You just pop the food in the fryer basket, in the drawer, turn the knob to the cooking time and thats it ! The basket seems quite large , so you should get reasonable amount of food cooked , probably ok for about 4 people. It comes with a basic instruction cooking times plus a small recipe book.<br>So far I have only done basic items like chips, pakora, fried mushrooms etc but all have tasted good. You pull the drawer out half way and give a small shake, and none of my food has stuck.<br>It comes out fat free and nice and light. My only problem is sometimes getting the times right, the first time I put frozen chips for 15 mins and it was too long and they burnt. However Its easy to set the time a bit less then pop them back in for another two mins with the turn of the knob.<br><br>Its also easy to clean, with just the basket and drawer needing Cleaning ( which are nice & lightweight ).<br><br>Overall I really like it, the recipe book has recipes for chicken and even brownies, which I will give a go soon and report back. So it seems a bit more verstile than just a fryer. I find the food tastes nicer, its so quick and easy that I really like it. I will keep updated but so far I really recommend it, it is pricey but if you are watching your fat intake, want quicket healthier food it might be a good investment."
"Looking something like an industrial size coffee percolator on steroids, this is a large (Measurements at its widest parts are Height: 32cm Width: 28cm Depth: 28cm), robust and heavy but stylish kitchen appliance.  The minimalist Design has two functional dials - one for the heat setting and another for the timer.  The lower part incorporates a drawer which houses the cooking basket and the upper part houses the mechanism. The basket is removable and easy to clean and comes with a removable divider for use when cooking a couple of different foods.  The power cable retracts into the body and therefore avoids the issue of cable clutter.  The outer body gets very hot when cooking and it emits an unobtrusive humming noise.  It produces no noticeable odour.  It comes with straightforward instructions and a colour recipe booklet.<br><br>If you are pursuing a healthy diet this appliance is excellent - it uses minimal oil and, after some initial experimenting, produces really tasty chips. When cooking home made chips you can get near perfect ones if you put in a few minutes effort and prepare them properly:<br><br>- Use suitable potatoes.  Supermarket labelled 'versatile' potatoes work fine.<br>- When cutting the potatoes after peeling them, put them in a bowl of water and then drain them to remove excess starch.<br>- Dry them with a tea towel.<br>- Add half a tablespoon of olive oil to a bowl and, a handful at time, coat the cut potatoes in the oil.<br>- Give the basket 2-3 shakes during the cooking process.<br>- Adjust the timer to cook them for longer if necessary.<br><br>Cooking a very large portion of chips for two adults takes approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>In summary, this is an expensive lifestyle cooking appliance.  However, the benefit of maintaining a healthy diet far outweigh the cost and I wholeheartedly recommend this innovative product."
"Very impressed by this 'air fryer'. It not only looks good, is healthy, but for many things it has replaced our oven. Probably not suitable for a family but great for cooking for one or two. To start off we had a go at chips, this is why we got it. I have never liked the deep fryer and pan cooked chips are smelly and unhealthy. We started off without adding any fat at all. The result for me was a bit too dry. Still a good chip butty with lashings of tomato sauce though! We found that the recommended spoonfull of oil worked a treat. The chip pan has finally been sacked in our house!<br><br>However this wonderful machine is not just for chips. It is a mini oven. We have heated scampi up and they tasted great. We have also warmed up croissants. As there is a seperator we were able to have the scampi in one side and the chips in the other. There was plenty for two people. It takes 3 minutes to heat up then 20 minutes to cook chips. It suggests shaking the basket every so often. The smells emanating from it are minimal compared to a chip pan.<br><br>Cleaning is very easy, even when you some oil in the cooking. Wipes off easily. The timer is brilliant and automatically cuts off when it has got to zero. This is great for people like me who forget the oven is on and end up burning things!<br><br>In conclusion I highly recommend this item. It has very quickly become an important part of our kitchen. It is healthier than a fat fryer and more energy efficient than a normal oven. It is a great little oven that looks fantastic as well. I think the people who are giving it poor reviews are not experimenting enough. The first time attempt at chips can be disapointing!"
"The AirFryer is meant to serve as a replacement for the chip-pan, allowing the user to make fry-tasting chips without the use of oil (or, one presumes, the potential to set the house on fire). It also purports to allow the user to cook a vast variety of other things - dumplings, chicken, and so on. This claim is actually reasonable, as the AirFryer, with a coil at the top, and an air-circulation system, is effectively a tiny oven.<br><br>Actually, it isn't that tiny. Its counter footprint is roughly the width, depth and height of two standard blender/food processors side by side, which can be a problem in a kitchen with limited counter space. This is exacerbated by the weight of the thing - at 10 kilos, it is sufficiently heavy that you won't want to be moving it about too much. On the plus side, the top of the device is flat, and so returns a little of the flat space if you need it - though it's probably best not to put anything on it during use.<br><br>The styling of the device reminds me of a fat plastic egg, in a shiny black; it doesn't look out of place amongst all the other kitchen appliances, and black always looks decently sleek - but nor does it jump out. Mine also has two large stickers on it, which aren't evident in the product photograph, but look too awkward to remove.<br><br>The handle visible about halfway up the egg is actually the handle for the food tray. On pulling the tray out, one finds a surprisingly compact metal area, with a drip space beneath. There is also a metal divider, which can be used to separate different types of food, should you desperately want to make chips and (say) chicken nuggets at the same time.  The tray area appears small at first glance, but takes roughly two medium sized baking potatoes worth of material (assuming they are fairly thinly sliced.<br>So, it's heavy, looks a bit odd, and has a pointless divider - but does it work? In a word, yes. I peeled and sliced a couple of potatoes , which fit roughly into the food tray, popped them in the tray, and then set the temperature Using the temperature dial) and the required time (using the large dial above the handle). A quiet hooverish sound ensued, and the timer made a satisfying ticking sound.  After half the required time, I pulled the tray out via the handle - the potato fragments showed signs of cooking, so I shook them about, and then put the tray back in the device.<br><br>After the total set time, the timer makes a fairly loud `ding', indicating it is time to remove the contents. Having pulled them out, and dumped onto a plate, I can say that the first batch were excellent, and largely indistinguishable from fry chips.  Having read a few negative reviews, I made several more batches over the next few days, and noted that results were a little inconsistent - sometimes the potato slices would be unevenly cooked, whilst other attempts produced excellent food. It seems that one or two `flips' are useful, allowing the user to monitor the state of their food, and also increase/decrease time as appropriate.<br>It's a shame there isn't a way to do this automatically, or a means of checking the state of ones food without pulling it from the AirFryer. This is especially true when the user steps outside of the Recipes provided, and starts putting other things into the AirFryer, without knowing exactly how long they will take to cook; an `'auto cook' option, as sometimes seen in microwaves, would have helped.<br><br>That said, the overall results are excellent, and the chips I made were uniformly very tasty.  This is a fun gadget, and certainly occasioned a bit of kitchen-conversation from friends curious about how it worked. It also makes very good chips. If you're looking to replace a chip pan, this is probably a good choice, but given the counter real estate it demands, it may be a bit niche.<br><br>Overall, it's easy and fun to use, and the end products are satisfyingly tasty but I think it's an indulgence, rather than a kitchen necessity."

If you're planning on having the AirFryer permanently out on your kitchen work-surface, then expect the fryer to take up a lot of this surface space.  When you open up the drawer, you realise that considering the amount of room the AirFryer takes up, it doesn't actually allow for very large portions to be cooked at once.  The basket drawer only really allows for around four medium sized portions of chips, or if doing two separate items such as fish & chips, then it would only cater for just two people's portions.  So, if you're planning on using this AirFryer to cook for a family of more than two people, then be warned that you won't be able to cook up all the items at once for the meal!<br><br>The overall Design of the AirFryer is very modern and contemporary with its polished hard-plastic black exterior.  This is ideal for a contemporary, modern or minimalist kitchen; but not very fitting for a more rustic or `country' style of kitchen (my wife thinks it looks like a miniature spaceship).<br><br>The AirFryer is incredibly easy to use from the outset.  There's no complex instructions or any daunting amount of cooking options or buttons.  It's a simple case of set the temperature and set the timer...and you're done!<br><br>It's always good to preheat the AirFryer beforehand for a good three minutes or so.  When doing so, be careful to take out the metal separator from the basket beforehand, otherwise you run the risk of burning yourself when extracting it after it's been heated to a high temperature (yep, been there, done that).<br><br>The AirFryer is very easy to clean after use.  Simply wash the removable basket in warm, soapy water and wipe out the drawer.<br><br>The AirFryer is not a 100% oil free fryer, so don't think that you'll be able to cook everything without having any oil in the house.  All of the homemade chips, wedges, roasties etc require a thin coating of oil before placing them into the fryer - usually around one level tablespoon will do the job.  Even though oil is used (and remember it could always be olive oil) this is still a far healthier option in comparison to deep fat frying.  Even roasting potatoes in an oven would usually use more than a tablespoons worth of oil, so this is certainly a cheaper and healthier way of cooking these foods.<br><br>Chips turn out well from the AirFryer, with little to no grease on them and they can be cooked to just the right crispy level to suit your taste.  However, the final result isn't hugely dissimilar to using the oven to cook the chips or wedges, so don't expect miracles here!<br><br>The recipe book that comes included with the AirFryer is very simple and easy to follow and was compiled to show how to obtain the best results from the AirFryer.  However, in places the Recipes are a little too basic, missing off vital specifics, such as the type of sugar to use when baking brownies in the AirFryer (i.e. castor sugar should be used).  So don't expect superb Quality Recipes from this small but handy book.<br><br>Portion sizes are another aspect of the AirFryer that needs to be highlighted.  The recipe book offers up dishes stating how many they will cater for.  However, if you were to prepare these meals to the portion sizes that they recommend, then you'd barely feed an ant with each portion (ok...so slight exaggeration there).  Twelve portions from a 15cm diameter brownie?  Surely you jest sir!  Four individual meals from four drumsticks?...I don't think I've ever had a meal that consisted of just one drumstick with chips.<br><br>All in all, the AirFryer offers a healthy way of cooking a wide (and relatively unexpected) variety of foods - from chips, to chicken wings, to quiches, to brownies.  However, if cooking for a family consisting of more than just two people, then be warned that only a very limited amount can be cooked in the AirFryer at once."
"Does fantastic chips, takes a bit of getting used too the timings. It all depends on the potatoes & which oil you use.  Found it great for crisping up pies, just heat them in the microwave then finish off in the frier.  Half the time, economic due to not having to have your oven on for an hour.  Will try the same for fish fingers or fillets.  Also great for doing Indian Samomas & Chinese spring rolls etc.  Gripes are, the pan could do with being bigger, it's not easy to get food out due to the high sides & the divider they supply is a  waste of time. Using fresh potatoes it definately takes longer than it claims.  However still a great product."
"I am very pleased to be using a method of cooking that is healthier but am not yet satisfied with the chips it produces.They have an uneven colour finish and are not as crisp as I would like. The best result I have had so far came after simmering them for 3-4 minutes,cooling and drying then following the airfryer instructions and airfrying twice! A time consuming portion of chips.<br>It is quite difficult to get a dish into the pan when it contains a liquid, like quiche, and even more difficult to get it out when hot. The temperature dial readings are not easy to read when a specific temperature is required,e.g. 140.<br>Having said the negatives, I like the quiet,clean & healthy airfryer and will use it frequently with perfect results I am sure, after further practice.<br>By the way-it looks terrific on the kitchen worktop!"
"This Phillips AirFryer enables me to eat chips without a guilty conscience as they can be cooked either without any oil whatsoever or with just a half teaspoon of olive oil to get a crispier result.  I am impressed with the healthy and speedy method of frying by hot air circulation.  As a vegetarian, I mainly use the AirFryer for potatoes but it can be used for meat, fish and chicken as well as frozen foods.  Snacks that can be prepared in the oven can also be cooked in the AirFryer.<br><br>The AirFryer comes with easily understandable written instructions and diagrams so it makes frying extremely easy.  Phillips claim that the appliance can be used by children of 8 years or over provided that they have been shown how to use the AirFryer properly. It really is simple to use and also very convenient. In addition, it is easy to clean as the basket and pan can be rinsed in soapy water.  Another positive point is that there is no lingering fatty smell that is the case with deep fat fryers.<br><br>When frying home made chips, I find that the AirFryer works best for just two adult portions of chips (about 3 medium sized potatoes or two very large ones).  I have put in a third portion but even though it was below the MAX indicator level, I found that there was a more uneven distribution of cooking and some chips were hard.<br><br>Overall I am very impressed with this Phillips AirFryer but my only reservation is the price.  Having got this appliance free I am delighted with it but if it broke down I certainly wouldn't pay the current price to replace it."
"Oh my goodness, what can I say about this wonderful gadget that others have not already said?<br><br>Well to start with, it's absolutely brilliant as a replacement for a full size oven. It basically does the same job, but faster, using less power and taking up only a fraction of the space of a full sized oven. I will be taking it in the caravan with me this summer as my most essential bit of kit - it will beat the caravan gas oven hands down.<br><br>While the promotional material suggests that this appliance is a healthier version of a chip frier and not much else, I think Philips have undersold it's other abilities. Yes, it does great french fries, but I have used it far more for cooking pies, beef burgers, falafels, pizza, oven chips, frozen roasting parsnips, roasting potatoes, battered oven-bake fish fillets, yorkshire puddings, salmon fillets, pretty much any frozen product that you can cook in the conventional oven, and even naan breads. It cooks in about half the time of a conventional fan-assisted oven (partly because it heats up in about three minutes) but mostly beacuse the unit re-circulates the hot air round and through the food and is far more efficient than a normal oven.<br><br>One point that I think needs mentioning is the built-in air filter - I was expecting there to be less fumes in my kitchen but I noticed no difference so I think the air filter part of the advertising is a bit misleading and having the filter seems to make very little difference.<br><br>The promotional material focuses mostly on the units ability to cook fries. I see that a lot of people have complained that it doesn't cook the fries well and they come out brown in places and undercooked in others. I found out the hard way that you have to cut the fries very thin (about 8mm by 8mm) and you have to follow the instructions in the main receipe booklet to get the perfect result other wise you'll get the same initial outcome that I did. Here's what to do:<br><br>Peel Maris Piper potatoes (max about 6 medium potatoes)<br>Use a french fry cutter (or cut very finely by hand (8mm x 8mm)<br>Rinse the fries under running water in a colander<br>Tip onto a clean tea-towel and gently pat dry.<br>Measure about 1 dessert spoon of olive oil into a large bowl<br>Add the fries and toss gently in the oil.<br>Heat the frier to 150 degrees<br>Add the fries and cook for 5 minutes<br>Remove from flyer and allow to cool<br>Turn the frier up to 200 degrees<br>Add half the fries and cook for 5 minutes<br>Open the drawer, unclip the food basket, toss the fries gently<br>Put back in the fryer for about another 5 minutes or until cripy and golden.<br>Repeat for the 2nd half of the batch.<br><br>DO NOT overfill the basket or the air can't circulate and you'll get burn bits and undercooked bits!<br><br>Overall, I'd give this fab gadget a 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for the rediculous price tag. When the price falls to something vaguely resembling a sensible price, I'll consider amending my score but not till!"
"From a design point of view, I would have no problem with leaving this on display on my kitchen worktop. It's very sleek and well designed, and is a good bit smaller than any deep fat fryer I've seen in the past. It can be used to cook many different types of food such as chicken, red meat and of course chips. The designers have even though of what would happen if you wanted to cook steak and chips at the same time, and therefore have included a removable separator for the frying basket.<br><br>The only downside I could see with the design was that it may be too easy to detach the frying basket from the base (and drip tray) of the fryer, as you generally carry these around as one unit. However, the button for detaching these is right where you would normally have your thumb when holding it by the handle! Therefore, if you aren't careful, you could end up with a rather heavy bit of metal tumbling towards the floor!<br><br>Once it is all set up (and this doesn't take long as it's only a matter of removing the stickers and giving it a wipe over with a cloth), all you need to do is place the food in the basket and select the appropriate temperature and time. Included with the AirFryer is a handy guide which gives the recommended settings for a range of different foods.<br><br>It is slightly nosier than I would have expected (probably similar to the noise an extractor fan would make) and can generate quite a bit of steam which comes out a vent at the back. The base of the unit also gets quite warm, but again, this is only to be expected.<br><br>All this would have been totally irrelevant though if the food had come out a soggy mess or inedible boards. However, I'm glad to say that it didn't, otherwise I'd have had no tea tonight! From a taste point of view, the chips tasted much the same as if they'd been done in the oven (maybe slightly less dried out) and cooked in a much shorter time period. Of course the main advantage though is that they weren't full of grease, and so this defiantly has to be the healthier option of \"frying\" food!"
"I've found that my fan oven cooks raw potato cut into chips and lightly coated on olive oil and placed on tinfoil into great chips."
"Absolutely great purchase. Had the actifry previously and although it was effective and healthy, it took up more space on kitchen worktop as well as taking considerably longer cooking times.The airFryer does the job and produces good results."
"Due to the May bank holiday I opted for express delivery, it duely arrived at 09.58 the next day, so yet again full marks to Amazon for delivery. Due to Health problems I was advised not to have chips, but I love my chips, so some time ago I purchased an Actifry which I loved until after 22 months it blew up with a puff of smoke. It was rather expensive so getting only 22 months use from it I felt it was a waste of money, and I was VERY reluctant to repeat the experience. I considered the Philips airfryer but feared a repeat of the actifry experience, then I saw Amazon had reduced the price and the Philips had a 2year warranty so I took the plunge. The actifry had an element of thin wire, like a toaster, the Philips has a much more robust element, like the grill on a main cooker, a confidence builder straight away. I have as yet only tried the basics, my beloved chips which turned out a little over done following the instructions, a lower temp and less time on the second attempt resulted in perfect chips. Others have described it as noisy, it isn`t silent but I wouldn`t say it was noisy, it`s easy to set up and use, doesn`t smell and doesn`t get outwardly too hot.. I am so far very pleased with the fryer and only time will tell how long it lasts. Amazon have now knocked another £10 off ( thankyou Amazon, I missed out on that) so don`t think about it, buy it.."
"Having used a Tefal Actifry for some years I decided to try a different make. Whilst the Philips AirFryer is a lot quicker, 12 minutes as opposed to 40 minutes for the Tefal, it does entail a lot more attention. Because the chips lie on top of each other, the portions that are not exposed to the hot air do not brown. To prevent this, one needs to remove the container after six minutes, give the contents a good shake and cook for six minutes more. I have found that this can still leave sections that are not brown and shake the container twice, once after four and again eight minutes. To improve the flavour, I cut the potatoes into chips, dry them off, and then brush them over with Olive Oil before cooking. It takes a while to get used to, but is a lot easier and cleaner than using a deep fat fryer, and wins over the Tefal Actifry because of the time saving."
"The air-fryer seems very good so far but the basket capacity is very small for such a large machine.  It can cook enough for two adults but no more than that.  So if you have a larger family you will end up opting for the convenience of using a conventional oven etc.  That said the quality is good and cooking times are quicker than I expected."
"This item was a replacement for a Tefal actifryer which blew up recently despite very careful usage.  I think it is far superior to my previous machine.  It cooks a range of things without the tumbling action of the Tefal, which did damage things, it's quick, efficient & easier to store as the surface area is smaller.  I also prefer the drawer action on the Philips, I found the lid on the Tefal had very poor catches & was apt to fly open!  I have only had it for a week but I have cooked a variety of things in it & so far I am very satisfied."
"I really wanted to rate this product highly.  The idea of a low fat fryer sounds great, but try as I might, after several months of ownership, I'm disappointed.<br><br>First impressions are great.  It's very well packaged, and when you do finally get it out, it feels like it's really good quality.  It's pretty heavy, has a very nice, polished finish and overall it really feels like it's a good piece of equipment.<br><br>And it is.  For chips.  First word of warning is that the cooking times in the booklet are too short.  You need to preheat it first, for about five minutes.  Second tip is you need to shake it during cooking.  Not once as they suggest, but several times.  And if you follow these tips, and make sure that when making real chips you coat them in oil first, then it makes a really nice plate of chips.  And frozen chips are even better.  You can have them all evenly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Great.<br><br>But now the down side.  Although the unit itself is pretty big, the basket is quite small.  In fact only really big enough for two helpings.  If you put more in, then they stick together, no matter how much you shake.  There's also a divider for the basket so that you can cook two different products.  We tried to do fish and chips this way, but it was pretty poor.  The chips were undercooked and the fish overcooked, even though we did our best.<br><br>So overall, particularly considering the price, it's a disappointment.  If it hadn't been so well made, I'd have thought it was a prototype product that was being tested in the market.<br><br>If you live in a household of two and you both really love chips, then it might be worth a go.  In any other environment, it will probably end up in the back of a cupboard after a few months."
"I have had a Tefal Actifry since they first came out about 4 years ago. Saw it at the Good Food Show and, being a gadget freak and a Slimming World member was interested in the Health benefits. It served me well enough, but I was never THAT impressed. The paddle used to break up whatever was in it, so when it started playing up (the lid catch broke), I read the reviews for this and thought I'd give it a go. It's soooooo much better. My first attempt at chips (coated in half a tablespoon of oil) were fantastic. So nice that I have them for tea too !<br><br>The first time I used it I followed the timing guidelines in the recipe book. A couple of the chips (and I mean only a couple) were very slightly underdone, but a lovely golden colour. So the second time I used it I cooked them for a couple of minutes longer at 150 and then turned the heat up to 200. They were perfect. I also took the basket out and shook them a couple of times more that it says to, (remember to take the basket out to shake as the pan part is heavy and could do some damage if it drops off on your foot).<br><br>It says in the instructions to put the chips into the basket one at a time so as not to poor any excess oil in. I just tipped them in (remember, they only had half a tablespoon of oil anyway) and the excess oil, what bit of it there was, drips into the pan below.<br><br>Slimming World chips are syn free if I were to use Frylight, but to me it's worth the \"syns\" to use the little bit of oil for a better tasting chip. They are still loads healthier :)<br><br>In summary it's a good sturdy machine and nice to look at. The basket and pan are dishwasher safe (always a plus) and so far I'm really happy with it. Seems a lot of money just to do chips, but to me it's worth it and I'm sure I'll do other things in it.<br><br>A lot cheaper than in Argos.<br><br>Cooks quicker and better than the Actifry, and beats it by miles.<br><br>Get one :)"
"This is great.  I wasn't sure about the idea but now that I've tried it and sampled some great new tastes - the Paprika potatoes and the Feta triangles in the included recipe book were great - I'm hooked. Very easy to use and the Health angle is pretty convoncing too.  For those of us who aren't regular visitors to the kitchen, it also has the advantage of being very easy to use."
"my son and myself have tryed a number of products to get perfect chips and this is the only one i found we did not like chips because they were greasy but now we have healthy chips crisp on the outside and flufy inside i could go mad on these chips but i limit myself to chips once a week i rate this the best chip and air fryer when you buy and try you will not regret it fantastic thank you amazon"
"I now wish I had bought this Phillips air fryer ages ago, but it was only the price stopping me.  With Amazon's latest reduction there  was no longer an excuse!  It arrived in a huge box, very well packed, and I got to work experimenting as soon as I had it plugged in.  Frozen chips cooked like a dream in half the time, came out crisp and gorgeously fluffy inside.  My own home made chips were fab, but took another few minutes to get the golden colour I wanted.  Tasted great.  I tried my famous chicken pie by baking the pastry  'blind'  in a tin which fitted the basket, 10 minutes later I filled it with cooked chicken keftover from a roast dinner, added mushrooms and a lovely sauce, put the pastry lid on, and 12 minutes later had a pie to die for!  I am still experimenting, and just wish it was slightly larger so I could cook fish and chips side by side!  Cutting down on oil and fat has made my husband's diet healthier and the bonus is my fat reduced cooking leaves the air fresher and cleaner anf I am saving money not having to change the old oil for new any more.<br>Off to experiment with roasting vegetables for a veggie lasagne!"
"I am, however, very disappointed in the Quality of the interior - after only using it for a short while, the black enamel inside has chipped in various places.  I have not bothered to complain earlier because I am really happy with its performance, but am worried about its life expectancy now the enamel is coming off inside.  Can you please let me know why this has happened and if it is a flaw in the product itself.<br><br>Kind regards<br><br>Linda Collins"
"A way of cooking chips and other foods with virtually no cooking oil.<br><br>This was the reason for buying it - being able to eat chips etc without the unwelcome calories of cooking oil.<br><br>As I had never heard of an 'air fryer' before, the recipe book that is included was quite welcome, to give me an idea of what it can do. I could see that there are a host of potato types it can make - chips, cubes, wedges, roast, croquettes, rosti, slices.<br><br>Other foods include, meatballs, chicken legs, roast mushrooms, peppers and seafood such as prawns.<br><br>It also comes with a 60 day money-back option if you are not satisfied with it which was a comfort because the product was fairly expensive.<br><br>There is a quick guide and a full guide, but to be honest it is a piece of cake to work out how to use it. First of all, take all the protective labels off (including the one inside). Then give the basket a quick wash. The top control sets the temperature and the centre control is a mechanical countdown timer that switches it off. A single ping is sounded when finished. If you want a longer alarm then you will need to use your digital kitchen timer.<br><br>Sizewise, it is about a foot high, a foot wide and a foot deep. It is fairly light and so it easy to carry for storage. It does however take up a lot of space on the counter top and it might be difficult to fit into most kitchen cupboards for storage.  The Design however is stylish and sleek and I wouldn't be ashamed to have it on view in my kitchen permenantly.<br><br>In operation, it does make a noise, like a fan on medium speed I'd say but it isn't really a problem and you soon get used to it.<br><br>You have also got to be mindful of the very hot air coming out the back - don't push it against a wall.<br><br>For my first batch of chips, I sprayed them with cooking oil, then placed them in the basket. The cooking basket simply pulls out, then press a button to lift the wire holder.  I set it to 18 minutes and shook the pan half way through to allow for even cooking.  Do make sure though to heat it up first or to count an extra three minutes into your cooking time.<br><br>They came out fine, slighty brown as I wanted and reasonably crunchy.<br><br>Benefits of device:<br>* Healthy - uses 80% less fat<br>* No greasy mess of a conventional frier or saucepan<br>* Safe - no dangerous, hot oil<br>* No greasy smells<br>* No disposal of cooking oil<br><br>Downside:<br>* It makes a noise, but nothing outrageous<br>* It will take up space<br>* They don't have the same taste as deep fried chips but that isn't really a major problem<br><br>I would recommend this device if you have the room for it and are keen on using a very low fat method of cooking chips and other foods."
"It does everything it says it will and more, the only complaint I have is that is doesn't come with the widget to enable me to cook cakes.  That in this case in an addition. But it does cook far more than chips. It is efficient, easy to clean and dishwasher safe.My only regret is we didn't buy one years ago!"
"Great product (had it for two weeks now). Oven chips-add no oil and they taste like they are fried! kids love them too-also they stay hot for ages too (don`t know why!) unlike oven chips<br><br>I didnt really believe all the hype and thought i was getting a small fan oven. This device is fantastic. I have used it every day. Mexican bean burgers taste great as do, vegetables and obviously chips. Have tried Roasties, they were good,but next time i will do them a little longer as they werent`t coloured enough-although still crispy and tasty.<br><br>For anyone on Slimming world this device is great for Quorn products and syn free chips. It really is fast too, get home pop in your oven chips and quorn product,get changed and...ding all done.<br><br>negatives...err...i guess its a bit bulky...errrr<br><br>its quiet, fast, cooks well, what more do you need..."
"I weighed up the pros and cons of this against the Tefal Actifry before buying and this won largely because of its looks and secondly because the Actifry has a problem with lids and paddles breaking.  As this has no moving parts and no lid, that would not be a problem.<br><br>We are a relatively healthy eating household but my kids do not like oven chips because they are too dry apparently.  So I decided to opt for a healthier dryer for that purpose mainly.  I was initially concerned at the capacity of this one against the 1.2kg of the 'Actifry Family' but although this states the capacity of 800g only, it is more than big enough to accommodate chips for a family of 4.<br><br>This appliance is not technically a 'fryer'. It is more of a small convection oven and that being said I have successfully cooked small individual frozen pizzas in it (in around 10 mins) and small pies etc.  It will cook most things you would normally think of baking so long as they are not too fatty (such as sausages) as the high fat content can cause splattering to the element and this would be difficult to clean.<br><br>So, chips!  Homemade chips are not the best in this fryer.  The instructions state you must soak the potato chips for 30 mins, dry and apply oil by hand to coat them.  Initially I tried doing this by using my olive oil pump spray - this did not apply enough oil and the chips were left very dry and chewy.  my second attempt I did by applying the oil in a bowl and mixing it through by hand as suggested, the results were better but still a little tasteless and chewy.  Oven chips fair a little better but unfortunately, there just seems to be no real substitute for 'proper' fried chips.<br><br>The bonus of this is that it heats up quickly, cooks quickly and with less fat.  It is therefore not only healthier but probably more economical than putting the oven on every time.  The jury is still out about chips fried in this but we are still experimenting with different oils and different chips!<br><br>It looks great in the kitchen though, although it is large."
"I have had so much fun cooking in this, no oil!!! Fantastic chips, brown on the outside and fluffy on the inside mmmm. Its also excellent to use as a mini oven ie breaded or battered fish.. I would NEVER want to be without this and have recomended it to all my family and friends"
"I am so pleased that I bought my Philips airfryer. My husband is very fussy about his chips. He has been on at me for years to go back to the old fashioned chip pan, I have resisted as for one its not healthy and two the mess of a chip pan. I have tried oven chips but he did not care for them. So after a lot of thought decided to get an airfryer. it seemed strange to be peeling potatoes to make homemade chips again after a lot of years. It was trial and error for a couple of times and I find by using the spray oil it works for me. You have to find your own preferance but all in all I am happy with my airfryer. I have not tried it out on other things but I soon will be. Ps my husband has not complained so they must be alright."
"I absolutely love it - for its ease of use and its versatility - variable temperature controls; a working timer; ability to cook two items at the same time; ability to cook a wide range of foods; easy Cleaning; odour free; healthy food.........<br>Admittedly it is large and heavy but this maybe an indication of its 'build quality'.<br>Previously had a Tefal Actifry (which packed-in after 13 months) and it could not compare in any way with the Philips AirFryer and should not even be considered as an alternative."
"Fantastic buy, have cooked frozen as well as fresh fish, frozen and fresh hand made chips, scampi, chicken and chops ALL without any fat or oil. come's out nice and crispy and golden brown. Going to try some cakes next. This fryer cooks what it says it cooks. A friend in the kitchen. Well worth the money."
"Love the Philips Airfryer. Had an Actifry before and liked it but found that the paddle sometimes broke the food up. It was also not well made and the lid broke first and then the paddle. Spares were expensive so decided to try Philips. I use it most days and would hate to be without it now. Heats up really quickly and cooks better chips than the Actifry. My new best friend."
"Unless you actually want food deep-fried in batter, the Philips AirFryer offers a crisper, healthier and often tastier alternative which requires almost no oil, doesn't fill the kitchen with the endlessly lingering smell of fat, and warms up in just a couple of minutes. However, real battered food such as deep fried fish and chips doesn't taste the same, no matter what you do to it.<br><br>If you want to know what the AirFryer really does, it's like a gigantic fan-heater where all the heat is blown across your food, dehydrating it a little and cooking it a lot. It has the same effect, in heat terms, as cooking it hot oil, but it does so without the oil. This is far, far healthier, means that it doesn't taste of last week's oil (important if you are doing home-style fish and chips one week and Chinese spring rolls the next), much quicker, and (I'm fairly sure) uses less electricity. It also means that the oil will never boil over, as it did eventually to every one of our deep-fat fryers, spoiling the filter and generally rendering the device unpleasant.<br><br>In terms of smell, it isn't entirely odour free. Especially if you are cooking chips, onto which you need to rub a little oil before you start, unless they are frozen chips from a packet, there is _some_ odour, though nothing that an extractor fan won't cope with and nothing at all like the odour of a deep fat fryer.<br><br>Cooking salmon is an absolute joy, whether fresh or from frozen, and the result is beautifully crisp. Mushrooms, similar, and many other kinds of food that suffer easily from being overcooked.<br><br>However:<br>If you want battered haddock and thick, pub style chips, it doesn't really do that. You can put batter on your haddock, and you have to rub some oil onto the chips, but, at least in all our experiments, you really can't get to something which is 'just like' fish and chips. As a way of serving potatoes, AirFried chips are great -- but don't expect picky children to accept them as 'just the same as the chip shop'. On the other hand, pretty much by definition, you can't have all the benefits of fat-free cooking and still have the fat.<br><br>There's just one other downside: this thing is huge! It's about the same width as a traditional deep fat fryer, maybe even a little less, but it towers to almost twice the height. Measure carefully before you order.<br><br>Otherwise, strongly recommended -- from Health, Safety, ecological and economical perspectives, this is a winner."
"I have had this airfryer for about 6 weeks now and it is probably the most used item in the kitchen. The fries/chips made with very little oil are absolutely best although I'm not a potato eater!<br>I have pretty much never read/followed the temp/time in the book as if you cook regularly and used an oven it's easy to just open it and see how much more cooking time needed.<br>I have used it to make marinated salmon (used to shallow pan-fry before), marinated chiken, chicken/meat kebabs, prawns...list is endless... and it tastes better as the marinades don't get burnt as in hot oil - it cooks everything very quick, less than a third the time would take in a conventional oven.<br>Easy to clean and it switches off on it's own when timer hits 0 which is great so you'll never burn food!<br>Using this device we've probably reduced our oil/fat intake by a huge amount as it needs little or no oil on foods that we would otherwise use quite a bit of oil<br>Recommend it to everyone....although due to the size it's not ideal if you have a large family, ideal for a family of 4 I would say."
"This is a fantastic appliance. It's so versitile, you can cook almost anything. Roast potatoes are amazing, chips are superb and toasted sandwichs are out this world. This appliance comes highly recommended."
"I've had this for a few weeks and I think Philips has understated the functionality of this.  I have a well eqiped kitchen but I'm using this more and more.  It's not an item that will end up stored in the garage.<br><br>Firstly - chips!  I use Maris Piper, cut large; blanche them in boiling water for 3 minutes; let the water evaporate off and cool; then I use some olive oil to cover them (using my hands!) and cook them for around 15 minutes at 160 followed by 15 minutes at 180. They never stick, they are crisp outside and fluffy and flavoursome inside.  THEY ARE MUCH BETTER THAN DEEP FRIED CHIPS - I know because I have Lincat professional double fryers - and they are now in the garage.  I even now use it for my roast potatos.<br><br>I've also been experimenting. Because they are \"Air\" they are also great at things like warming croissants.  Bring the temp up to max then pop a croissant in for 2 to 3 minutes.  Crisp just like in France.  Also ..... chestnuts!  30 minutes at 160.  I've also done some great Char Siu Pork.  Because it blows air and the meat doesn't sit on a surface - it cooks without burning sugars.  It's also great at sausages .....  Anyway if in doubt .... buy."
"After much debate wether to get this or a TEFAL actifry i watched a couple of video,s on you tube and we decided on this to be honest it seemed to be quite a bit quieter than the tefal,It arrived quickly tried it out and i must say i was very impressed i love it, and its not just for chips nor is it the gimmicky type of machine that you may think,got some greggs sausage rolls from iceland and this little beuty cooked it to perfection and i do mean perfect, some things take slightly longer than stated but that,s an issue with both machines ,It,s very easy to clean and operate it,s basicly a fan assisted oven and it works brilliant so if you are looking to ditch your chip pan look no further i have had it a while and i think it,s brilliant ,HONESTLY five star hope this helps ,johnm2432."
"Having read and researched deep fat fryers, this model appealed most. The promise of less use of oil not only is good on Health grounds but also promises much reduced smells in the kitchen.<br><br>I opened the box to examine the fryer, cleaned it in readyness to make tempura fish and veg.  After all, one review claimed it could do so easily.  Once you get into the preparation mode, you question \"where does the oil go\" for frying the food.  The basket has a clear \"no oil\" symbol stamped into it.  The Philips website has tempura Recipes but they are not for use with the air fryer.  The fish recipe in the handbook uses breadcrumbs instead of a wet batter.  Then when you dig into reviews and articles about the airfryer on the internet, we began to realise that the claim about being able to cook tempura is based on a single unsubstanciated quote (including here on Amazon) which is requoted throughout internet sites without question.  Well, we did find an australian review which said pretty much what I began to suspect at this point, that the airfryer is not much use for cooking wet batter foods.<br><br>As this is my prime requirement, luckily not having used it as yet, I repacked the fryer back into its original wrapping and box, and am now waiting for collection on its return to the vendor for a refund.<br><br>I appreciate that my requirement is a very narrow use of this product which, in fairness to Philips, it does not claim to satisfy.  Indeed, the claims it makes for those items in its recipe booklet look indeed very credible and good. And as I have not used it for those, I cannot comment with any authority.<br><br>Therefore my main comment is that if you are looking to use it for wet batter food, the airfryer does not appear to be a good choice."
"After seeing the advertisement on TV I had to try the Philips Airfryer.  It is a good as I had hoped.  The fryer is well made and beautifully designed.  My wife and I are still experimenting with various foods and so far we have had excellent results."
"What great little product. Read the reviews before I bought it and was nearly put off when some one said it was difficult to take basket out. I don't know what planet he/ she is on but the product is simplicity its self to use, I have tried using it as a baking oven with out the rather expensive baking accessory, and it works perfectly. I'd recommend it, and have."
"When I recvd this I was looking forward to it as I was used to the tefal actifry , unfortunately it took too long to heat up and the chips came out very dry and hard<br>I tried several options with more or less oil but all to no avail . i even tried sausages but they blew up all in all not a good experience for me I will now go back to the actifry<br>at least I know how that works I have requested a full refund , perhaps you will have abetter experience good luck"
"A bit sceptical as to its claims,but surprised at the results.It does make lovely chips(a bit like restaurant quality) No fat, very little to clean after use,remains quite hot for a while after use.A really good buy."
"I was really keen to try the Philips fryer as the idea seemed well founded but unfortunately the product came up short.<br><br>Chips were really good, crispiness wise, and the recipe book was awash with so many different ways to cook chips but still basically  chip Recipes.<br><br>With not much else one could be forgiven for thinking that this Philps was a chip cooking gadget. If chips are your thing then 5 stars as long as you cook alone or maybe for 2. The fryer basket will not hold 4 portions unless you (and 2 others) are on starvation rations.<br><br>It does cook crisper chips than my Tefal actifry, the actifry chips are soggy and have a distinctive taste which is not unpleasant. ( Philips 1 Tefal 0). But I have never soaked my raw chips for 30 minutes as per the Philips guidelines.<br><br>Going away from chips I tried a fish cake recipe but before I even got to the fryer my results were a soggy mess, I did follow the recipe to the letter but the \"mix\" was far too sloppy, it would have just oozed through the wire mesh basket. In Bills cook book we are advised to throw the fishcake mixture against a hard surface to toughen up the proteins (not tried).<br><br>Finally I would mention that Philips wire mesh fryer basket was hard to clean, it did not hold portions large enough to feed a Big Man plus his spouse never mind a family of 4. The locking mechanism was poor and fiddly, the basket got scratched on the top just by pulling in and out a couple of times.<br><br>If you want a chip maker that stands on your worktop then get this. You will not be disappointed."
"Was a bit sceptical as to how this would work but proved to be excellent product and am very pleased with the quality of chips it produces. Does not hold enough for a larger family but ideal for two hungry people. Very quiet and no fatty smells - surprised just how good it is and would not hesitate to recommend it. The low fat chips can only be a good thing........... also works really well on chicken drumsticks !!!!"
"Very impressed with this machine.  Only got mine a day or so ago and have had some lovely chips made in it.  Very fast and efficient and flexible too being able to do things such as quiches in it!  The lack of a rotating paddle means you have to shake the chips yourself while cooking but it does mean a suitable cooking tray can be used in it too for these other dishes."
"I bought one of these with the view to using it instead of a deep fat fryer and in that respect it is very good. In all fairness I have to say that if you eat a lot of chips of roast potaoes then this is the one to have but in my experience I really found little else it could do that my fan oven did'nt do better and a lot cheaper than the £160 that this cost. Fortunately for me Philips were offering a 60 day no quibble refund if you were not satasfied, so mine went back and I received my refund this morning.<br>I will say that this machine is well built, far better than the Tefal but they both have their limitations and both cost a lot of money."
"This is one of the best additions to my kitchen in a long time!<br>Guilt free 'fried' food, that tastes wondeful. The machine does everything it's supposed to do, and then some.<br>Had some shop bought half baked bread and thought I would try cooking it in the AirFryer. It worked like a dream.<br>Easy to clean after use. No smells and oil splatter.<br>Really love this product, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
"I am a forgetful ,lazy  widow in her 60's, this machine has transformed my eating.<br>instead of suddenly realizing it was 9 p.m. and  i had not eaten anything and settling for a banana sandwich, i now  open the  machine, put in  fish, scampi,steak pie, springrolls...anything  you might grill or put in the oven, turn a dial and  go back to playing games on facebook,  the food cannot burn  as it is on a timer so when i hear the 'ping' i dish it up and  lovely hot comforting food is ready.<br>was so impressed i bought  one for  each of my daughters.<br>to heat up and oven for a small amount of food is hugely wasteful, this does not need to warm up first so the power is used only to cook...and it dosn.t heat the kitchen wastefully either."
"As I write this there are 147 5 star ratings and 20 1 star ratings.  That's a lot of 1 star ratings!  Here is what I think is happening.<br><br>Most of the 1 star reviews were written between December and March most of the 5 star reviews were written between March and November.  Could this be something to do with harvest times and storage?<br><br>The advertising material suggests you can take a potato from your cupboard, chop it up, soak it, dry and oil it and airfry it for 20 mins and you will get chips that look like the photo.  For me this couldn't have been further from the truth. Mine were dry, burnt on the outside but soggy and gelatinous in the middle.  I used Maris Piper potatoes and tried all of the various methods given in the various books and leaflets with minimal success.  King Edward's are meant to be even better for fried chips but were equally disastrous.<br><br>I was about to send the fryer back but came across an article on the web that suggested that supermarkets stored potatoes so that they retained their looks but didn't cook in the same way as fresh.  So I tried different potatoes from different sources and had more success.  The best I have found so far are Rooster red potatoes.  When double cooked as in the recipe book (not the instructions) they produce an edible chip that doesn't go soggy for about 5 minutes.  Rooster potatoes cooked as wedges are quite nice but, like the chips, they taste more like baked potato than fried.  This makes sense - a lot of the fried taste comes from the high oil content and from the fact that there is a large volume of hot oil in close contact with the potato.<br><br>So I would make two suggestions: 1) Set your expectations appropriately.  If you want chips that look like the photos and taste like chip shop chips then keep the packaging to send it back!  If you want lowish fat freshly cooked potatoes that are pleasant to eat then go for it.  2) You must be prepared to experiment and search for potatoes and cooking methods that work for you.<br><br>Other observations:<br>I believe the airfryer needs potatoes that are more suited to baking so dry varieties may do better.  I will try Melody and Romano varieties next.<br>Adding oil with an oil sprayer after the regular shaking seems to help.<br>Adding paprika, jerk seasoning, asafoetida or turmeric to the oil adds flavour missing from the frying process but watch the turmeric; it stains everything it touches.<br>Adding vinegar makes the chips go soggy very quickly.<br>Amazon's returns policy says \"Defective Merchandise: includes any item that does not perform as expected\" so should be returnable.  Philips included a 60 day no quibble return slip in my airfryer.<br>I plan to keep my airfryer for convenience even though it doesn't do much more that my Neff circotherm oven. I will also keep my deep fat fryer for the occasional treat when I must have real chips, e.g. with steak.<br>The airfryer does cook Tikka and the like but makes a real mess.  This may help if you don't own a grill or an oven.<br>The price for what you get is outrageous if I wasn't absolutely desperate I would have sent it back and if I have a choice I will avoid Philips in the future."
"When my husband suggested we purchase this item I thought, here we go, another kitchen gadget to clutter the place and gather dust. I was so wrong! This is definitely the best kitchen item I have had in years. It's like a mini fast oven and fryer combined. Anything I would normally fry or bake I  just put in the fryer, the basket ensures unwanted fat drops into the tray below. Fish, bacon, sausages, chicken wings, duck breast, pies, spring rolls, onion rings, spare ribs, lamb chops, they have all come out perfectly cooked. When I get time I plan to try the oven part, see how a cake turns out. In my opinion a really versatile device and well worth every penny."
"I purchased this because I'm trying to keep my cholesterol down and I do have a passion for fried food. This is a sort of device that you can't take straight out of the box and expect first class result first time. There are so many variables with cooking different foods that it does require experimentation and patience to get the results you require.<br><br>My first batch of chips was a disaster; I had the temperature wrong and forgot to give them a shake half way through but I did eat them. After a little experimentation, I can now cook reasonably good chips; you really must give them a shake after every 3-4 minutes to get a good even cook. Despite the manufacturers contrary comments regarding cooking sausages, I find that they cook quite well without the white smoke that Philips claim will emit from the fryer (as a Muslim, I only cook halal sausages which contain a lot less fat than the normal ones).<br><br>The only food (and it is not mentioned anywhere in the manual) that does emit white smoke is frozen battered fish portions; 12 minutes at 200 degrees and they're cooked to a treat. Chicken nuggets, fish cakes, fish fingers, they all cook very well in this fryer. To sum it up, I am very pleased with the results I get from it and I can eat more knowing that the saturated fat is reduced by at least 80%.<br><br>A good buy and a good product. The only hassle is have to wash it out after each use, but it doesn't take that long and it's a lot easier that Cleaning a deep fat fryer. Highly recommended."
"This is something that everyone should consider as it is cleaner and does not have smells covering the kitchen.<br>You cook with very small amounts of oil in the worst case and when you are finished you have only two items to wash or you can put them in your dishwasher. It reduces time to cook and is very simple to use.Cooking times are reduced as well."
"I did have my doubts the Air-fryer although all the reviews were so positive.<br>I need not have worried, the machine is brilliant as you can cook so many<br>different things other that chips, wedges and baked potatoes.<br>I tried cooking sausages from frozen which took just 12 minutes, they cooked<br>to perfection.  I ordered the cooking pan for such things as apple crumble,<br>mince and all the other things that you can cook in the Air-fryer. I really do<br>think they are over the top with the price, I have not used it yet so cannot<br>comment on it. If stuck as what to cook in the Air-fryer just look on the You<br>Tube site for other Recipes that are not in the recipe book."
"I previously owned the Tefal Actifry and when that wore out after five years of use we thought we'd try the Philips air fryer.  The Philips Air Fryer is far worse than the Actifry as it doesn't have a moving paddle that turns the chips.  The result is that the Philips burns the chips on one side while they're raw on the other.  This doesn't happen with the Tefal as the rotating paddle flips the chips over to prevent them being burnt.  The Philips  instructions day that one needs to take the basket out and shake it every ten minutes but that doesn't seem to help much.  With the Tefal one just put in the chips and twenty minutes later they're done."
"For the last year or so, I have been following a pretty decent diet regime - basically calorie counting & avoiding high-fat foods.<br><br>I used to be a big lover of chip-shop chips, and perhaps they were part of my downfall over the years. Not that I ate them in excess, but I guess as one gets older the body metabolism gets a little slower trying to convert those fat rich, high calorie foods into meaningful energy & muscle. So much so that I soon gained weight despite of a fairly active lifestyle.<br><br>Since I started this diet over a year ago I have lost around 3 stones; and after purchasing a treadmill & weights and pushing myself through a more vigorous routine of exercise, my middle-aged body  is beginning to look a little leaner at last. But I still afford myself the odd monthly trip to the chip-shop, as the home-made chips I bung in the oven covered in Fry-Lite, doesn't quite match up to expectations despite the health-benefits.<br><br>So I started to look for alternatives to oven cooking, and after some debate between this fryer & the popular Tefal, I decided to go with this purely based on the fact it has no paddle to stir the chips, which may well be a good thing to begin with, reviews suggest that over time the paddle does snap off and is quite expensive to replace.<br><br>I won't go into great detail about the AirFryer, because this has been discussed in many other reviews here. All I wanted was a device that cooked chips better than any oven, and cooked them more healthily than any deep-fryer. But my first 3 attempts at cooking chips in the AirFyer did not lift my hopes! Using ordinarily baking potatoes, and then new potatoes, I followed the instructions from the User Guide, as well as experimented based on comments from reviews here, and tried to cook the perfect chip.<br><br>But despite trying different combinations, the end result was quite disappointing both visually and in taste. But not being one to throw in the towel, I bought some Maris Piper potatoes and did the following:-<br><br>1/ peeled them & chipped them using a medium-cut chipper<br>2/ soaked them in a pan of water for around 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>3/ draining them from a sieve and letting them dry out naturally (15 minutes)<br>4/ put them in a colander for a final shake, and then doused them with a few squirts of FryLite- shaking as I go.<br>5/ Put them in the AirFryer basket and set the temperature to 160, with a cooking time of 15 minutes (I didn't both with pre-heat!)<br>6/ After the time was up, I increased the temperature to 180 and a cooking time of a further 10-15 minutes. On both cooking occasions I made a point of stirring (rather than shaking) the chips  with a wooden spoon every few minutes.<br>7/ On completion, I let the cooked chips \"rest\" in the basket for a minute or so before taking them out and serving.<br><br>My first words after eating the first couple of chips was something like \"OMG!!!\"  They were absolutely perfect!! Crispy & well textured; visually pleasing with a golden brown finish; they were firm & not limp or soggy like my first 3 attempts with baking potatoes. These Maris Piper chips were totally spot on, and I have to confess to saying these were the best tasting low-fat chips I have ever had! They taste even better than chip-shop chips as well, primarily because there's no fatty aftertaste, and above all I could eat these with a healthy conscience :)<br><br>I know this fryer has a multitude of other cooking capabilities, and I will looking forward to trying them out. But in terms of cooking the perfect healthy chip, this is most definitely the fryer to have! The thing to always bear in mind when cooking your particular perfect chip, is to \"NEVER GIVE UP!\"<br><br>Experiment, and read the reviews of others here, and you won't go wrong.<br><br>5/5 Recommended"
"If you are used to conventional frying this item may seem a little daunting to look at but after reading the instructions and trying it out it is fairly easy to use and does come up with the goods.  Items I have fried have come out as they should (And not soggy or limp as I feared) The only reason I knock a star off this item is its rather big and not exactly something you would want if you have a small kitchen and little space."
"Great machine - fast and clean, in daily use now for over a year. Perfect and chips (after some experimentation), roast veggies, bacon, sausages, fish, cheese on toast, puff pasty pie lids all in few minutes with much less to clean than pans/oven."
"My teenage daughter is a very faddy eater and consumes huge quantities of fast food despite my best efforts to get her to 'eat healthy', so I was delighted to see this and decided to give it a go.It was an instant success - not only because the chips we made were delicious but because it was so easy to operate and clean.The novelty has worn off slightly after a few weeks but it's still used on a very regular basis and - interestingly - my daughter no longer really enjoys the oven chips we used to buy by the sackful. She's also experimented with her own coating for chicken pieces - again much healthier than the bought kind.  An added bonus for me is that the amount of residual grease and mess is minimal compared with either a deep fat fryer or trays of greasy food in the ordinary oven - everything is really well contained in the unit, and easy to wash afterwards, in the the sink or dishwasher. Having a timer is another 'plus' - you can go and do other things during cooking and know you won't come back to a kitchen full of smoke! The only criticism I can think of so far is that capacity is not huge; one very generous portion or two sensible ones is the norm. However, the unit is already fairly large and would have to be much larger to hold more, so it's a sensible compromise.Definitely a good buy; qualifies as essential kitchen equipment in our household now!"
"We purchased this on the recommendation of some friends and we are realy glad we did.<br>Started off nice and simple with fat free chips. Then progressed to flavoured sauty potatoes.<br>We then tried chicken and then pork. Both came out to perfection.<br>De-frosted part baked rolls only take 4minutes to be crispy and brown.<br>We are well pleased with this purchase and would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.<br>It is a revolutionary and very clean way of coooking."
"Was searching for a replacement for our old Tefal actifry as the central rotator had partly broken and it was well out of warranty.<br>Glad that I opted for the Airfryer- completely agree with another reviewer's comment that it does not damage delicate food unlike the actifry.<br>Makes me and family feel healthy as there is a big-time reduction in oily food that can be 'air-fried'!<br>Minor squibble if I were to be picky is that squishy food can get stuck to the mesh, but that is washable- Alterrnative is to put a heat resistant plate that fits just inside the mesh with the squishy food placed on the plate- mesh is left clean and plate will be easier to clean!<br><br>Overall very happy and highly recommended"
"Great product, makes fantastic chips that are healthy. Also they are not all dry as expected, they taste great and it looks good on the kitchen side. It is quicker than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a good amount, although a family of four big eaters may need to make two lots. I haven't tried anything else in this yet, as I am so pleased with just the chips. Really easy to clean, I don't ever want anything else."
"I bought this on a whim. Having been brought up on good old Scottish meals like \"Glasgow salad\" aka mince pie, chips and beans... I still love eating chips and other fried foods, but as I get older I see the value in at least trying to eat more healthily. But who really likes rabbit food and smaller portions than the kids get?<br><br>Aye, this really does combine the best of both worlds! Who would have ever believed in healthier fried foods that taste just as great, without all the grease!?<br><br>And... not only is the air fryer easy to clean, but so is your plates & cutlery.<br><br>Buy it... if you really like your fried foods."
"I recently purchased the Phillips AirFryer after my wife complained about using our traditional deep fat fryer and the amount of oil you have to use, the smell it creates and the general un-healthiness of deep fat frying!.  We do not fry very often which means either replacing the oil every time or using slightly stale oil which mars taste and produces odours!<br><br>I did my usual research (for which Amazon is invaluable) comparing the Tefal Actifryer to the Phillips Airfryer.  The main difference seemed to be in build quality, reliability and the overall price of the unit.  The footprint (which is smaller), aesthetics (sleek, modern and quite discrete sitting in the corner of the kitchen) along with price, functionality and the 60 day no quibble money-back guarantee all swayed me towards the AirFryer.<br><br>After receiving the AirFryer from the as ever reliable Amazon I had the unit set up within minutes and set on 3 minute preheat to \"fry\" some chips.  I'd soaked the potatoes beforehand and \"fried\" a full basket for about 18 mins on 180.  The colour was great however they were not as crispy as I expected.  However, having read some reviews I think with a bit of trial and error I will soon cook the perfect chip with little or no oil!<br><br>The AirFryer works more as a mini oven than a fryer so since then I have tried various foods that I would normally grill or bake in the oven.  Marinated chicken with skin on came out succulent with crispy skin.  Fish fingers and nuggets were perfect.  The main advantage is its size - rather than heating a whole oven and the cost of that, you simply preheat the AirFryer for 3 mins and your food is cooked in approximately 3rd less time.  Although I have to admit the tray is not huge so you cannot cook mountains of food, it is still adequate for our small family.<br><br>This is definitely a kitchen gadget that will not sit in a cupboard gathering dust and I envisage using it regularly for health(ier), delicious food!"
"I purchased mine way back and it was down to the good reviews, I then purchased one for my daughter, this week-end just gone my daughter-in-law came for a wee visit and she was taken by my Philips AirFryer, I ordered her one saturday afternoon, they had intended to stay till the monday but due to work commitments they left sunday, which as it turned out it was lucky they left on the sunday as the order arrived this morning.  So she was able to use at tea time, brilliant product, brilliant service, well done and thank you xxx"
"Arrived quickly.  Only one attempt at making chips yet but can be a bit diddly as you have to take them out and shake the chips around which in my case needed the use of a spatula.  Chips were a bit soggy but maybe I need to practice.  Unfortunately for me, two days after buying the product everybody seemed to reduce the price by £30!"
"This is one of those great kitchen gadgets that actually earn their keep - I have hardly used my oven since getting it. First thing to clarify though: it's not a fryer; doesn't fry anything - it's a small, fast convection oven. So if you really want to fry something, this won't help with that, but anything that you can heat up, roast or bake in an oven, you can do in this, and a bit quicker and more economically. I have cooked a small beef roast joint and it came out well - its a bit trial and error as to timings but if you take a few minutes off the standard oven timings it should be about right.<br><br>Chips. As many of the reviews point out, this is where the air fryer excels. I must admit I haven't been to the trouble of making fresh chips so can only comment on the frozen variety, but the first thing I did to try the machine out was throw a handful of frozen chips in and blast them for the recommended 12 mins......tried them and thought 'wow!' - best oven chips I've ever cooked. It's gets them very crisp and golden but nice inside. There are two key factors in producing a result like this. First is the timer; because you set a precise time, it's impossible to overcook (so easy to forget when using a regular oven). The other factor is the Quality of the chips. A lot depends on personal taste of course (whether you like your fries skinny, or thick, crinkled etc) but I would strongly recommend trying McCain Home fries, give it 12 mins on full heat setting and prepare to be amazed at how good oven chips can be. The Speed of cooking can be a real asset - or perhaps your downfall; from the moment you decide you suddenly fancy a bowl of chips, you can get them started in the ad break and 10 mins later you're eating them!<br><br>In practical terms, its well built and tries to look 'sleek' in its Design. You do need a suitable corner of your worktop to 'park it' but it wont look out of place in a smart kitchen as its kind of hi-tech looking. The drawer pulls straight out and the basket detaches at the press of a button, and both can be easily washed either in dishwasher or quite quickly in the sink. I think the simple timer control (just turn it to the amount of minutes you want) makes it really simple to operate - might make it an ideal gift for anyone who finds cooking a real challenge and cant deal with tricky gadgets. Whenever I have to use someone else's microwave - or cooker - i often struggle to work out what i'm doing and regret the passing of the simple timer controlled microwave control; this harks back to that, so its simple for all to use. Even your kids can now cook!<br><br>The price for this machine seems to vary quite a lot. From a fairly pricey RRP it was advertised  recently on tv (by a retail store) at a nicely discounted price. When I then checked on Amazon and Argos they had both matched that price, so thats when I got mine. I see now that the price has gone back up so worth comparing prices before buying."
"Absolutely fabulous product - whole family are delighted and enjoying healthier and tastier food in double-quick time! Every home should have one, probably the best gadget we've ever invested in. Wish we were on commission as everyone who has seen ours has added it to their own 'wish-list'!"
"This is by far the best food maker ever. If u want something quick nothing will beat this.. Just give it a try and you wont regret it and @£90 its a steal."
"I bought the airfryer 12 months ago but from kitchen science as it was cheaper but thought I would list some of the pro's and cons of it's use as I live in a busy house so the airfryer has been used at least once a day for a year mainly to cook McCain crispy french fries and thought it would give any potential buyers a idea of what to expect as it's quite a costly purchase.<br><br>THE PROS:<br>It makes nice fries once you've worked out the best settings to get the fries the way you like them (I put them on 200 degrees for 17 minutes & shake the basket once about half way through cooking).<br>It's fairly easy to clean just use hot soapy water or put in the dishwasher although it also recommends using a degreaser spray which I'd agree with.<br>THE CONS:<br>The timer dial occassianly sticks so you lose track of where your fries are in the cooking cycle and it also means the airfryer won't switch off as the timer has to reach zero for that to happen so you have to switch off at the socket once you've finnished frying.I've also noticed after a year of Cleaning the basket & bowl have started to fade in colour which I fear may mean they will need replacing soon as the manual states the black coating is required to help with maintaining the temperature & circulation in the airfryer,so I put a picture in customer images to show what I mean.Also when you remove the basket to shake what your cooking the airfryer keeps going and the heating element is exposed which seems to be a potential Safety hazard."
"Had actifry before I purchased this air fryer, plug connection inside actifry split in half after two years. This new air fryer is far better. It is easier to use and cleaner. Food is better with no paddle to break it up. It is quieter and no smell. More types of food can be cooked with no danger of it being  broken up."
"I always research a product before I buy and I go on more than one site to read reviews from online magazines, which reports, Amazon customers, Argos etc., I chose this over the acti-fry which is currently very popular but did not meet my personal criteria.<br><br>This product did not fail my expectations. The nice thing about this fryer is that the kitchen doesn't steam up like ordinary electric fryers, the food was perfectly cooked, tastier and not greasy. Although the tray doesn't look very big, we all ate a decent portion of chips and there are 4 of us (adults).<br>Cleaning the tray was a breeze, the instructions say it is suitable for the dishwasher, but it was so easy to clean I washed it by hand in seconds.<br><br>I can't believe we waited so long to buy one! Guilt free food, cooked to perfection, tasty, no mess, clean kitchen! Love it :)"
"Everything all the other reviewers say about how great this is for cooking is very true. I have used it for chips, spring rolls, fish, chicken and chops and they have all cooked perfectly. Unfortunately after every use my flat smells like a chip shop and my febreze consumption has gone through the roof.<br><br>Every other device I use doesn't have this issue of smell."
"I love fried chips, however, the old deep fat fryers make to much mess and smoke and aren't very healthy at all.<br>Most kitchen gadgets end up underneath the kitchen worktop in a cupboard with the rest of the none essential equipment that's never used, but not this fryer.<br><br>This philips fryer is a fantastic product used by all in our house.<br>Its quick and easy to use and tastes great with chips. I agree, its not as nice as deep fried chips, however, its a better taste than oven chips.<br><br>We used to put frozen oven chips in the oven that took about 20-25 mins to cook. With this fryer, its set to 190 deg, and cooks frozen chips in less than 10 mins.<br>I also put frozen richmond sausages in here, and again within 10 mins, they taste superb, as with frozen battered onion rings.<br><br>My wife has cooked a couple of cakes in there, they taste really nice. She also puts in the small pre-ovened baked baguettes in there and they taste superb. There's many other things that you can cook, but for the time being we've only cooked the mentioned in this review so far.<br>The only little snag, is that it won't feed a family more than three persons, due to the size of the tray, however, with the small amount of cooking time, this is not an issue.<br><br>Overall.a very clean, versatile easy to use fryer.<br>Very well recommended."
"this is a brilliant purchase and have now tried it for several different types of chips and low it. The fresh taste without the fat. Great for the diet.<br>On thing I have not quite mastered is quantity and seem to always manage to put in too many chips for us to eat."
"I have been an air fryer fan for a long time now and I really loved the chips made by my Actifry.  The problem was that I kept having to replace various of its working parts (I've had 3 spare paddles, 1 pan and handle and 2 platic lids, plus 4 filter covers) AND I was on my third Actifry.  These machines were not cheap so I was reluctant to make the foray into another brand.  I finally had to when the vanes which turned the paddle on my last Actifry disappeared. (Don't ask me how, they just did!)<br>I viewed this Phillips machine at a local store.  It was priced (then) at circa £200.  I thought it was far more robust than the acifry but I just didn't get the feeling that it would be as good, so I left it where it was.  How wrong can you be??<br>I was lucky to find one on Amazon that was on special offer. It was about £100, so I thought 'what the heck'<br>It is amazing.  Far stronger that the actifry and makes chips that are far superior.  It is also more versatile as you can cook all sorts of thing in it that you couldn't with the 'paddle' machines (e.g. baked eggs, baked cheese on toast etc.)<br>I would certainly recommend this machine over its competitors.  It is easy to clean as well.<br>The only downside I can think of is that its lack of paddle prevents parsnips from rolling up into a ball (which often got talked about at 'family gatherings for roast dinners), but I can live with that!<br>Highly recommended. Well done Phillips!"
"i<br> would give this more stars if i could its used every day one of my better buys<br>there is nothing that has nt  cooked well in it"
"I bought a Philips AirFryer through Amazon a few days ago and I'm very happy with it's performance. The whole processs of making a batch of chips takes about 70 minutes: 5-10 minutes peeling and cutting; 25-30 minutes in a bowl of cold water to remove starch; 5 minutes pre-heat the AirFryer while drying the chips and covering them in a tiny amount of oil; 25-30 minutes cooking (depending on the batch size and how brown you like them) with shaking every 5 minutes or so. But they don't need constant attention so the process can be dovetailed into other activties. Unless you like your chips crispy and oily the results are very good; complete, even, cooking and a nice coating. The unit seems robust and well made and easy to clean. A good buy, recommended."
"This is a great product! easy to use, clear instructions, not too big sits nicely in the corner and doesn't smell when cooking! Easy to clean, only a humming sound when cooking and a bell when ready. Great chips - crispy and actually taste of potato. We've done wedges, samosas, chips fresh and frozen even warmed up sausage rolls. We love it and its much better than we thought. Cut up my potatoes and soak them the night before and cook the next day take around 15mins and a spoonful of oil so healthy too!"
"I echo all the other positive reviews of this machine. I use it most days for all sorts of things. Have done chips, roasties, toasted sandwiches, roasted veg, sausage rolls, bacon, fish fingers, carrot chips, sweet potato chips, sliced aubergine for moussaka, sausages, some chicken which then went into a stir fry sauce. All v good.<br>The main reason for writing though is to all those who did not receive a separator. This also happened to me. I went on the Philips website, through live chat and they immediately sent out the separator. Don't let this missing part put you off. Get on to Philips and they will sort it.<br>To be honest though, I have hardly used the separator anyway."
"You may have read about the 'useful food separator' that lets you cook two different foods (i.e. chicken nuggets & chips) together. Just to let you know that the version sold by Amazon UK (and probably elsewhere, too) doesn't actually include one. It's an optional extra, at some cost, and Philips are out of stock of separators in the UK anyway. If it wasn't such a good product I'd be sending it back so will have to put this down to experience I guess. :("
"After using a conventional chip pan for many years and having to clean up all the mess causing by the oil / fat. we decided to purchase an Oil Free Fryer. We read all the various reviews of the Phillips, Tefal and Breville  Fryers. and what each would do.<br>We purchased the Philips Air Fryer and it seems to be the best choice we could have made. Not only does it do chips but you can use it as a mini oven. We have cooked Battered Prawns, Spring Rolls, Chicken Pieces,Mushrooms and Onion Rings to name a few. All have been cooked to perfection as the heat is  circulated all round even underneath. When cooking chips you need to shake once or twice during the cooking time to ensure all are cooked, they my look slightly different but the taste is very good, It takes about 20 minutes to cook chips for 3 people after the chips have been soaked in water for 30 minutes to remove the starch.<br><br>When we were purchasing this fryer there were several other Philips Air Fryer models available, but you could not fully understand what the main differences were, it was only after we read the instruction leaflet which told you about the attachments these other models came with and what each model did. You can even bake cakes etc in one model .<br>My only slight criticism is I have been trying to purchase a trivet to fit inside the cooking basket so as to be able to cook more food without stacking it on each other but without purchasing the model which comes with this trivet I am struggling. to purchase on so I will have to make one myself.<br><br>Overall I would recommend this fryer to anyone, its simple to use has no moving parts to break and it gives good results, you can switch it on, them leave it alone, apart from shaking the chips."
"I have this product now 12 months and works absolutely brilliant! Excellent built Quality and functions very well indeed to get chips, roast potatoes and many other foods dry air heat fried without adding a drop of oil."
"It makes a superior oven chip and its French fries from frozen are every bit as good as those from a conventional fryer. I've tried it on frozen battered cod and that's as good or better than the oven heated variety. I also tried it on Kentuck style fried chicken (poached in milk 20 minutes, double dipped in spicy flour, left to chill in the fridge and then brushed with olive oil - a tablespoon will coat 4 pieces) and these were also extremely succesful. Not quite KFC, but a very acceptable alternative. It will do four chicken pieces, probably 8 with a bit of rearrangement half way though though I haven't tested that.<br><br>It easily cooks two very ample portions of chips. From frozen they take about 15 minutes, so its very doable for a family of four or five (one batch being kept warm in the oven as the other cooks).<br><br>Extrremely easy to clean. Highly recommended."
"Great product, shame the Design causes the draw to be scratched as you take it in and out. Beware pan as extra to use for other cooking costs over £20 we had 2 delivered out of shape before one arrived ok.The cooking possibilities are endless but you are governed to size portions for one and two only."
"Saw this on TV and so we bought one. We expected to be able to throw the deep fat drier away, so we did. BIG mistake! After a few attempts cooking chips in the AirFryer we went out and bought another deep fat fryer. Do not buy this if you only intend frying chips, its next to useless, it cooks them but they taste awful. What it is good at is frying sausages and other items, fish fingers are another food it cooks well, trouble is you need this to cook the fish fingers and a deep fat fryer for the chips!"
"The product works ok but I can't help thinking I have wasted my money. It's not a fryer it cooks through hot air so I could get the same result from my oven. You don't get that deep fried taste and texture. Yes it's healthier than a normal fryer but this is not a fryer! I wish I had saved my money and just used my oven instead."
"Brilliant , much better than a deep fat fryer ,I actually feel virtuous eating chips like my mum made and there other uses too.Easy to use , clean and have."
"I've owned one of these for one and a half years and it has worked perfectly without problems.  It has seen a lot of use.<br>It always makes the best chips I've ever had at home (better than most restaurants too) and of course they are low in fat as well.<br>Taste, texture, moisture and crispiness are all spot on.  Whether you make skinny French fries, fat wedge type chips with skin on, or everything in between, the results are superb.<br>I suggest that if you follow the instructions your chips will be absolutely lovely, whether you use oven chips from the supermarket or chop your own potatoes.<br>I cannot understand any reviews that suggest the chips are poor and can only assume that these reviewers have not used the unit correctly...<br>I don't use this for anything except chips, so I can't comment on other foods.  I've never tried the Tefal air fryer either, so I can't compare that.<br>There is a smell of cooked chips during and after use, but nothing like the smell from a deep fat fryer and the smell disperses quickly too.<br>Cleaning is as easy as you could hope for.<br>Personally I think the white model looks more aesthetically pleasing in the kitchen, but the black model is always cheaper to buy.<br>Slightly expensive for a chip fryer (whether you choose the white or black finish), but if you eat chips twice a week or more, it's definitely worth it in the long run.<br>Fully recommended product."
"Purchased to replace a Tefal actifry which finally gave up the ghost just over two years since purchase. The Philips has a smaller footprint than the Tefal, but is taller and perhaps a tad noisier, however, it doesn't have the paddle which means that more delicate foodstuffs can now be cooked. It's Design also means that there is less to clean unlike the Tefal which has to be partially dismantled, however, the basket of the Philips does not seem to hold as much food.<br>The Philips appears to be made of better Quality materials and given it relies on analogue style controls should be a longer lasting device (here's hoping!).<br>On the day of delivery, a highstreet retailer cut their price for this Philips so that it was £30 cheaper than Amazon....just our luck.<br>All in all, a worthwhile device which makes 'frying' so much cleaner a task."
"Better than expected so easy to use no smells and very little cleaning required all with the added benefit of being healtheir"
"We have had our Philips Air Fryer for about a month now, and have cooked a number of things in it ... All with excellent results using no more than a couple of teaspoons of oil.<br><br>Frozen or fresh, the results have been very good ... Baked items like samosas or bhajis were hot and crisp, fish works very well, and even left over new potatoes can be perked up with a little spice.<br><br>Our favourite though is spiced sweet potato chips ... Ready in about 20 minutes ... Delicious and healthy.<br><br>Very easy to clean, a quick soak, wipe out and dishwasher will do the trick.<br><br>This is the perfect size for up to four people for chips ... Portion sizes might seem a little mean if you try and cook for more."
"Smells loads better than deep frying smell that doesn't linger and stick to clothes and surfaces. Obviously it won't taste the same as deep fried but didn't expect it. If you use oil as advised and add your own seasoning you get great tasting potato snacks or meal portions. There is room to cook plenty of desired food unlike what is stated in some reviews depends how much of a pig you are. overall excellent product apart from food separator is sold separately"
"This is an excellent low fat fryer. The chips are very tasty, and while not oil-free have so little oil that this is not an unreasonable title. This is well and solidly made unlike some of the competition, having had several of another brand which all broke down. It is also very good Value for money."
"It's a nice looking piece of equipment.  The chips which we started with looked good but didn't have quite the flavour of fried chips (obviously). I have since done other things, roast potatoes were good, spicy bean burgers, onion rings general stuff but it is great. Very clean in operation. Good to cook things all in one thing instead of having frying pans and oven going.  We are loving the fact that there is so little oil/fat involved and it will greatly help in lowering cholesterol in time. I think my grandchildren will still prefer the deep fat fryer for their chips though. Definitely worth a try if you are health and diet conscious."
"Apart from chips, I have used this to bake small items such as sausage rolls .  I tried a similar item which had an opening lid, but as I have cabinets above all the work surfaces I had to pull the cooker to the edge to open it. A bit of a burn hazard.  As the cooking chamber on this airfryer is a small drawer it doesn't need much headroom. The chips are golden, crispy and soft inside and virtually fat free."
"Works well if rather noisily. Chips take quite a long time (over 30 minutes) to cook properly but does well with portions of frozen chicken or fish. Not true to describe it as oil-free since you do need to use a small amount of oil. However, nothing wrong with oil, just try to use a \"healthy\" one."
"I purchased one of these as the 'hype' from a friend made me think it would be worth trying. As soon as I started reading the instructions the fact that they recommend you use oven chips rather than potatoes to make chips, it was all downhill. Next I read that if you do decide to make chips from potatoes, they should be soaked prior to cooking for half and hour then thoroughly dried. Yeah right!! Then during the half hour you are cooking them, it is recommended that you remove the basket and shake them to ensure even cooking a couple of times. And the amount you can cook at one time is only sufficient for two hungry people at best.<br><br>Back in the box it went - if I want oven chips I'll cook them ........ in the oven!!!"
"This is not just another kitchen gadget.  The airfryer genuinely offers a high level of convenience for someone who is rushed in the kitchen, doesn't like Cleaning the oven, or is looking for a healthier alternative to frying.  There are a couple of drawbacks to be wary of however.  It takes a few attempts to get used to cooking times, and the price for the same model fluctuates wildly depending on where you shop.<br><br>When starting out with the airfryer, put your food in at the lower end of the timescale printed on the instructions until you get used to how long it takes to cook things.  You can always add some time on after, because it only takes a minute or two to go from well cooked to incinerated.  I often make my own chips with it and it took a bit of practice to get the timing right.<br><br>Don't expect your chips to be as good as traditionally double-fried in beef dripping fare.  The way the airfryer pushes super-heated air around your food will make your chips crispy, but it also dries them out.  This is why you need to add a bit of oil to the chips if you're making your own (pre-bought oven chips are already coated with oil).  I like to spice my chips up a bit with chipotle infused oil and some five-spice.<br><br>Airfryer chips are easily better than those done in a normal oven, but the time taken to cook them will vary depending on how thick you've cut them.  I steamed some potatoes the other day, I changed my mind and wanted them crispy; so I chopped them into discs before coating them with a drizzle of oil and spices, then put them in the airfryer for 12 minutes or so, they came out great!<br><br>Anything that can be cooked in an oven can be cooked in the airfryer.  Again, it takes practice to get used to timings, and if you're cooking anything really greasy (the instruction manual says not to) keep a good eye on it and use common sense...super-heated air at 200 degrees with hot fat make for a smokey kitchen.<br><br>There must be something about the way the airfryer works that really locks in the flavour of meat compared to using a conventional oven. The burgers I did in mine were among the best I've tasted...and as my bathroom scales would tell you, I've eaten a lot of burgers!<br><br>The airfryer is relatively easy to clean, especially if you have a decent dishwasher (spouses are included in that statement).  The basket slides out and also separates, so you have the basket itself and the drip tray. It's much easier to clean than a deep fat fryer! Overall it's nicely designed and doesn't feel cheap even though the exterior is plastic.<br><br>Now, the kicker.  Watch what you expect to pay and do shop around if you decide to buy an airfryer.  I bought my one (the HD9220/20) for £89 only three weeks ago.  The exact same model is now selling for over £100 in the same shop (I like curry but couldn't buy it there), I also found that it's almost double the price I originally paid elsewhere!<br><br>I think Philips have realized they're onto a good thing and appear to be matching their prices with their Tefal competitors.  I saw one retailer (named after a Greek town but don't expect to see Jason) that was charging so much for the basic model that it was only a few quid cheaper than the family sized touch screen version!<br><br>The Airfryer is a great device once you get used to it, and just be prepared to shop around a little."
"I love my air fryer, so far i'm trying everything in it.  It doesn't leave your food oily and greasy, but you still get the crisp effect that you'd have if you deep fried your food. Food is healthier which is good too when you're trying to lose weight.<br><br>The seller dispatched the item very fast and it was with me within two days.  The item had obviously been opened as the instructions and cook book which came with it had been opened and the box to the item had been resealed, although you could tell it had never been used to cook with."
"Very disappointed with this product!<br><br>Felt poorly made and above all the chips were not as expected, pale and not crisp?<br><br>Plus this is limited to other foods which can be cooked in it compared to another Brand of fryer on the market!"
"I brought this mainly to fry chips. I've only used it a few times and though it does reasonable job I haven't been able to get the taste you get from oil frying. Need to do a little more experimenting."
"What a great product: easy to put together and even easier to work.<br>Washed well and looks smart. I got black.<br>Recipe book was a bit limited so it was necessary to buy another (see as advised) , which has some super ideas .<br>makes fabulous chips as long as you follow the instructions, but now used for delicious creamy garlic mushrooms, fish cakes, scampi etc all home made, i.e.cheaper and tastier.<br>It also uses less electricity as it cooks more quickly than conventional methods"
"Have only used it a few times,and only roasted potatoes , which were quite good.would have liked to use it a bit more before writing a review"
"Previously had an actifry but the paddle started to mush everything up so stopped using it.  This is fab - no paddle just hot air which cooks in half the time that it would take in the oven.  Only really used it for fresh chips, frozen oven chips, chicken nuggets and fish fingers and cooked everything fabulously - nice crispy chips and the real chips only need ½ tbsp. of oil.  Can't recommend enough although it is quite expensive and I only really use it a couple of times a week so a bit of an extravagance but who cares - love it."
"Extremely happy with the fryer. Highly recommended. Bit noisy. smoky for certain fooods like frying chicken.<br>For small family can manage all cookings except baking without an oven. Much quicker and less power hungry than oven. Good buy. No oil at all for any thing!!!!! Isn't that good enough?"
"Simply the best Chip Fryer by a mile, I have tried all the rest and this wins hands down.<br>Lovely crisp chips with a soft and fluffy centre, no grease or fat.<br>Goodbye to frozen and oven chips"
"I bought this about 8-9 months ago. I am satisfied with it. Initially I tried to fry with no oil at all and the result was not great. I now add a tea spoon olive oil to whatever I am going to fry and the results are very good. Of course, deep fry is tastier but not healthy. I am pleased with the fact that my house if not filled with frying smell and that the machine is very easy to clean. it also heaths up very quickly. I do recommend it. I want to buy one for my mum. the only downside is the price!!"
"After reading mixed reviews I was a little nervous about ordering an Airfryer, but after I heard it was half price on Amazon and had a no quibble return with Phillips I decided to try my luck. I'm certainly happy with my fryer so far and have used it about 6 times. We've made meatballs, chicken & chips and all have come out perfect. I think this is going to be replacing the oven for most things (except maybe pizza as I can't think how to fit one of those in the fryer, unless it's a micro-pizza!)"
"We chose this machine over another well known make which had poor reviews. This one is excellent. So far we have mainly done potato wedges , roast potatoes and oven chips . Great for a chip treat. Tasty and low fat . Cleans easily in dish washer. Handy for is as our new kitchen has a single oven so this fryer takes the pressure off when we want to use the grill."
"We never eat chips in our house for Health reasons so thought I would give this a go and what a fabulous surprise. Not much oil and fab chips wedges and loads more. We think it is great and would definately reccommend"
"Makes good chips quickly with hardly any oil.<br><br>It's actually a radiant ring inside with a circulating fan, nothing really high tech and for £90, Phillips must be making a killing! But it does work well, and makes nice food."
"Works OK with oven chips, but not as well with add-oil items.<br>The Tefal gives much better results, but has reliability problems. We have had 2, and the average expectancy is 12 months before they have a terminal breakdown, just out of guarantee.<br>Other options are the glass bowl variety, at almost a third of the price!<br>We have had ours for years, and is more versatile in its' functions."
"I am usually non critical with most appliances I own in one way or another despite some quite bad design flaws, and I can also suffer quite badly from brand loyalty from time to time, but positive reviews made me think this was the ideal gift for me when I received it 2 years ago at Christmas, but hey don't be fooled, it's huge, heavy, not very pretty, neither of which are reasons not to buy it of course, but one thing is for sure, it's a waste of money and overpriced!<br>Basically it's a fan oven for the worktop, with none of the advantages of one, it's small inside, as the majority of the bulk is the workings of it, squeeze the button on the basket handle at the wrong time, and it'll release the base cover onto the floor and break it, and doing chips is quite frankly a joke, oiling all sides, on top of drying them off, by the time I'd done I've lost my appetite! (This is how the instructions tell you to do potato chips) I don't see the need for a timer when you have to constantly stand over it agitating your contents while they cook, because if you don't you end up with charred offerings on the top, and the rest of your anaemic coloured chips beneath. The same goes for anything you put in it, the inability of it to rotate it's own contents renders this appliance as a rather large paperweight.<br>If you like turning your food whist it cooks every minute or so this may work for you, but me, I was looking for something that may require my attention less frequently, I could have probably coped with every 5 minutes or so, but when I use it I feel like I have obsessive compulsive checking it every minute it's running.<br><br>My tip, buy a Tefal Actifry instead, I wish I had :-("
"We have had a Tefal Actifry for about five years, three of which it lay in a cupboard unused and we used a deep fat fryer instead.  My wife detested the smell of oil that pervaded everywhere after each cooking session, so the Actifry was brought back into service.  After about eighteen times in use, my wife returned to the kitchen after a short absence; there was a sudden bang and the Actifry was on fire.<br>Enter the Philips which was ordered from Amazon and we have no regrets about this purchase, so far.  We fry chips from raw Maris Piper potatoes with half a tablespoon of Flora sunflower oil and the results are excellent, tasty and well cooked with no smell, although we do have a cooker hood with an extractor.  Highly recommended."
"I think this is good. Chips can be cooked with fry lite for very healthy option but if you use Rice Bran Oil sparingly they taste and look better. This oil is very healthy and does not clog your arteries. You can cook veg, burgers, sausage fish and all with no hassle good product"
"My little boy loves chips but we don't want him to eat any deep fried food. This \"amazing\" fryer seemed like a good alternative; it has so many positive reviews.<br>However, we were totally disappointed. Despite following the instructions and shaking the chips every few minutes, we never got properly cooked chips. The chips were always burnt outside, mostly in the corners, and raw inside. We tried both fresh and frozen chips and the results were always disapointing.<br>This \"fryer\" is just a small and expensive fan oven. Waste of money!"
"some people at slimming club told me about this fryer and when i could afford it i found amazone was the cheapest i have found this very good  and uses very little oil very healthy"
"After looking at which n what airfryer i wanted and which would be best for the size of my caravans kitchen I picked this and so far ive cooked every day with the fryer.<br>Taken some get used to cooking chips and I love them. Only a few sprays of frylight into the airfryer for cooking and lush chips with none of the fat n calories.<br>Meats never been so good a little seasoning into the fryer and jucie tasty meat comes out! the same goes for chicken and fish.<br>So easy to clean in the dish washer or just good old fasioned washing up liquid and hot water works just as well."
"I used it for everything - fish and chips, chicken, prawn crackers, yorkshire puds, vegetables (instead of roasting). It has halved my cooking time in the kitchen. The only thing dissapointing is it sets of the fire alarm quite quickly, though I dont see or smell the smoke."
"Dont be misled by the title, you can do so much more than just \"airfry\" sure you really can get good crispy chips with no oil at all (unlike the others we looked at) but this has become used as much as the microwave. Frozen sausages 7-10 mins from frozen depending on size. We have cooked chicken (plain and coated) chops, frozen sausage rolls, cakes and puddings. just find a small tray to fit in the bottom and away you go. The fact that you have to use the timer means that you can do other things without worrying that the food will burn. Also like the divider that allows you to cook separate foods at the same time. Easy to clean but dont be tempted to leave it till next time as the fat collected out of the food i.e. sausages etc will collect in the bottom and burn. we did our homework as these things are not cheap really recommend that you look at this"
"My Air fryer is the most useful item of kitchen equipment that I have purchased for some time. Besides being competitively priced, it works brilliantly. Very quick to heat up and easy to use.  So far I have cooked sausages, bacon  chicken portions, small cakes, bread rolls etc. All cooks evenly and quickly. Fresh or frozen chips are delicious as also are mixed veg. Any excess oil on food just drips to the base, so the food does not sit in oil if you have used too much. Simple to clean either by hand or dishwasher. Great addition to my kitchen"
"You still need to use a tiny amount of oil when cooking.<br><br>To be honest only used it so far for chips and the 'fat' ones seem to turn out best.  They are not crispy though and not golden brown more like burnt brown.  I follow the cooking times but still seem to come out on the burnt side.<br><br>Product is quite large and bulky so would not recommend if you have a small kitchen"
"I didn't believe this until I tried it. No more indigestion from chips. We eat them just once a week and as they are pre-cooked in oil before freezing this actually releases excess oil trapped in the chips. Not a cheap piece of kit to buy, no quicker or cheaper to run than an oil filled electric fryer; but no expensive long life oil to buy!"
"Read all the reviews and which reports for airfryers and decided to go for this one as others on market had such bad reviews, so glad that I did as really pleased so far...great chips, roast potatoes and chicken. With  50% off at amazon, 2yr guarantee with Amazons peace of mind as well, what more could you ask for?"
"very happy with this product only takes a little oil saving us money teaspoon oil sprinkle on chips before use, chips take 20 mins after 10 mins shake chips,super"
"so it's basically a funny-shaped convection oven<br>It didn't fry what i expected to( plaintains) , it just roasted it.<br>i admit I didn't find any info about whether it would or not but decided to take the chance and it didn't pay off. i am now trying to get rid of it."
"this is probably the best fryer on the market today, small enough to do one portion and big enough for the family. I won't be going back to deep fried oil again"
"Love the airfryer but as this was a present I was disappointed to find there was no separator as in the one I bought for myself contacted Phillips no luck there but on a plus note delivery was excellent"
"I bought the Philips airfryer expecting a lot and it didnt let me down. Cant understand the negative reviews. I have only had my airfryer for approx 4 weeks and cooked so far frozen chips ( not tried fresh potatoes as it seems too fiddly ).  The chips came out perfect. Have cooked crumbed prawns, scampi, chicken kiev, onion rings, fish fingers, crumbed fish portions, potato croquette and chicken nuggets all of which have turned out well. I have a list of things I still need to try but wanted to give an early review because I am so impressed. I have already ordered another as a present. I did try Fray Bentos tinned pies which 10 mins on 200 turned out just like in the oven. I have never reviewed anything before but if I can find out how will update my review in the future. 5 stars from me"
"Oh my goodness....I can't praise this enough. Tastier, healthier meals, cooked quickly and no odours. I baked a rhubarb crumble in it in 20 minutes (45 minutes of gas saved!!). I phoned up Phillips and ordered the divider as it doesn't come with this model (£20 inc p and p) so I can cook complete meals in it. Even my husband is a convert; he would only use the chip pan. Love it, Love it, Love it....thank you Phillips and Amazon for a speedy safe deliver."
"Fryer works well, but you need to learn how it should work for you. Although the book that comes with it has some guide lines you really need to adapt those times and temperature to your needs. Suggest that you check the food more than once during frying time and start with lower temperature to then have final minutes at a higher one. It really does the trick and my children said that their fries tasted like the McDonalds ones so it seems to work!<br>Although read about its size before buying it i was still surprised when i took it out, it's not small but i have to say it does look well manufactured. It is a little bit noisy but I have other kitchen cooking appliances that make more noise so it's not too bad.<br>I will probably buy it again although next time i might go for the higher one as depends how many people you need to feed the basket for the food might be a bit too small. Currently OK for 2 adults and 4 kids but i'll certainly need to use it twice when they are teenagers!"
"I have used this to cook:<br><br>Chips<br>Whole Chicken Breasts<br>Roast Potatoes<br>Frozen chicken/fish fingers etc<br>Fresh or Frozen FishCakes...<br><br>Almost anything that will fit ! - Great Item for the kitchen, and I'd certainly be lost without it now!!"
"Hi<br><br>I purchased this item and the instruction leaflet claimed that the children in France prefered the fries from this product.<br><br>Both my wife and I followed the guide for perfect fries and even bought a bag of frozen chips to test it, the results were far from satisfactory with home made chips becoming like cardboard and inedible to the frozen chips staying limp and not crisp.<br><br>We have had better results from cutting chips par boiling them and then giving a spray of oil before putting in the oven, a far cheaper option than the half price unit at £100.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Ian"
"I gave up on my deep fat fryer a year ago. Difficult to clean, too much space, old oil disposal and unhealthy. The Philips addresses all these problems and by trial and error I cook fresh and frozen food two, three times a week to the way I like it. Well not quite, I miss that something that a little excess oil gives to food. For that reason alone, 4*."
"Chips only taste slightly better than oven chips - unless you smother them with oil first - so there is still the compromise between Health and taste.<br><br>Where this does win out is convenience and speed of cooking - much quicker and easier than faffing around with oven shelves and trays etc."
"This is a great item which I use a lot .<br>I do my chips in here (virtually fat free ) and they taste perfect !!"
"I'm not very impressed."
"I managed to sneak this onto my wedding list without my other half noticing and thankfully a kind relative bought it for us. It has now become one of our most used kitchen gadgets. I won’t go into detail about how chips come out (they are great!) - Lots of other people do this in the reviews below. I would like to point out some of its other uses - for example it is great at reheating things quickly, things that you would normally stick in the oven and have to wait for it to heat up, sausage rolls, pies etc. It does them in about half the time, most things you use a fan oven for can be cooked in this quicker and in my opinion better! My favourite is to do a jacket potato in the microwave and then stick it in the air fryer for 5 minutes - it finishes it off perfectly as it had been cooked in the oven for an hour."
"I do not know what I'm doing wrong!!  I've read the reviews on here which prompted me to purchase this air fryer but, for some reason, I am really struggling to get the lovely crisp chips shown.  I have followed the recipe book and leaflet to the letter and have even tried several different \"chipping\" potatoes, soaked the for 1/2 an hour, 3/4 of an hour and eventually 1 hour.  Dried (extremely) well, did preheat, set timers, turned with wooden spoon etc -  NO good results. Last nights batch were awful and ended up in the bin (I'd tried with M&S Maris Pipers purchased in the morning) so tonight when my steak is cooking my homemade chips will be cooking in the oven!.  Very disappointed."
"This is probably the best new kitchen product I have bought for years. I thought it would cook sauteed and fried potatoes adequately and the odd chop or sausage. In reality the airfryer is awesome. It does all this brilliantly and in a fraction of the time, but it does so, so much more. In a small kitchen it will be a little noisy but cooking smells are at a minimum and  the results are just wonderful. I have used it so much it will eventually wear out (I guess) and when it does a new one will be on order immediately.  If you love food but hate fat and hot oil, buy one - you won't regret it"
"Arrived in good time and good condition really pleased with this purchase"
"Excellent!<br><br>For awhile I had been thinking of getting one of these \"Air Fryers\". But was undecided, when there was a good offer on this. So got one.<br><br>Easy to unpack and assemble.<br><br>Also very easy to clean.<br><br>It does an amazing job to say you add no oil or anything extra to cook. I have made sausage rolls in it fine. Sauages, burgers, even battered fish all cook nicely in it. Chips did not come out quite as I had expected. More like crispy snacks.<br><br>The onlt thing I have found it does not do well is bacon. It just does not seem to taste nice.<br><br>The temperature can be easily set on the front all the way up to 200oC. The only slight down side is that you can not forward the timer, which means you have to unplug it to stop it cooking. Small problem.<br><br>I can not recommend this highly enough. The amount of fat which comes out and drops into the bottom, shows you what you would normally eat. Is excellent."
"I can't love this airfryer enough!!!!! No faults at all!"
"Following the death of our deep fat fryer we considered an air fryer for a long time, wondering if we would use it enough to justify the high price compare to get a deep fat dryer instead. The potential Health benefits swung it for use and we went for it. I'm really glad we did!<br><br>Initially, the chips just didn't taste right and with good reason. While it takes longer to cook them, this air dryer delivers crisps, dry chips and the not the part soggy, mulch type chips I'd been used to. I buy frozen chips to use as they tend to come coated in oil, so I can put them straight in, no pre-soaking potatoes or drizzling on olive oil. It isn't just chips you can use it for, as it essentially is a small fan oven, so you can use it for baking as well if you so wanted.<br><br>It's a doddle to use, a dial on the top to set the temperature and a timer on the front to set the... well, time. A drawer to put in whatever it is you're cooking and a handle to pull the drawer out! The drawer and basket seem to be dishwasher safe (we've had problems). We use ours pretty much every day, far more than the deep fat fryer ever was, and have had no issue with it whatsoever which is a testament to the build Quality and has proved value for money.<br><br>To sum up, I love this fryer. It's high Quality and with some experimentation with time and temperature produces some great, evenly cooked food. the only down side is it's encouraged us to eat more chips! But at least we're not clogging our arteries with fat any more!"
"Works ok but not as good as an actifry"
"Great product! Everything tastes so much better, just try it and you,ll agree."
"This is one of my favourite  kitchen appliances. I cook assorts in it. Delicious and healthy"
"This product is absolutely brilliant,  I love it, no more oil smell in the house, no more changing  oil either. The chips come out crispy however if you over cook they go dry, after a while you tend to know how long to leave the timer on for so not a problem. I have been raving about it to everyone, its one of the best products in my kitchen. Its safe and so easy to use plus it makes me feel good that the family is eating healthier. I recommend this product as a good purchase."
"These are brilliant so easy to use and the results are fantastic fat free chips. The last batch I made for four adults I used only 30 calories of oil. Does everything it says and so simple to use. They suggest shaking the chips in the container, don't, as it is so easy to separate the basket and carrier and drop one of them. I just shake them up with a spoon.<br>Now I can enjoy chips without worrying about the calories and fat all you need to count is the calorific value of the potatoes."
"Well should I buy this or not ? .....my goodness we are so glad I did , it's absolutely great . Ok the chips are maybe dryer than some would like but it's up to you how much oil you sprinkle on , we just sort of smear  our clean hands with a small amount and rub over the chips ......just perfect every time , and how we like them , takes about 10 minutes, remembering to shake them now and again so they don't stick. The Fryer is so easy to clean , have cooked chicken breasts and a apple cake , both came out fine too . It is the cheapest from Amazon who I love to buy from as their back up if ever need is just first class. It arrived very quickly too . It's not a huge contraption but fits nicely in the corner of my kitchen . It cooks me and hubby enough chips , but I suppose you could put more in for required . It does jacket potatoes great too taking about 30 to 40 minutes depending on size of potatoes . I have put 4 in when we have company ,a reasonable size too as they filled the basket . I have said whenever we go on holiday I'm taking it with me! The only downside is my big main oven as got the sulks it's become redundant !!!!"
"This is NOT a fryer, but rather a tiny electric fan assisted oven. Chips taste the same as if you drizzle them with oil and put them in the oven to bake, the dry air sucks the moisture from the chips and leaves them very dry. Real fries have to be fried in oil not drizzled and baked. if you have an oven you don't need this gimmick. I thought this was going to give me great tasting healthy chips! I feel I was conned."
"I love this however if you put fatty foods in this fryer like sausages all the fat will deposit all over including insider the outer casing of the motor.Mine works great however very disappointed that the fat stored inside the upper case is impossible to clean therefore sets off the smoke alarms all the time. Its a shame hardly ever used and I only cook potatoes or frys in it never sausages or chicken. Other wise would of given it 10/10<br>However still good for those who want to lose weight. I find the basket comes away on its own so the lock struggles time to time."
"This is one of the best purchases of my life, since it arrived I am eating chips everyday without being worried about the fat. the chips are fantastic super tasty, I only use raw potato because I love the taste of potato. It is very light weight, easy to clean, looks very pretty in the kitchen and I can't recommend this item more."
"This is an excellent appliance. We have used it to cook chips and fish with good results, & are sure that it will have many other cooking uses.<br><br>However, I have given it 4 stars because I think that the product description is slightly misleading (although ingenious). It is really a small FAN-OVEN & is not totally 'oil free'. But, because of it's compact size, it is more economical than the large fan oven in our cooker when cooking small amounts."
"I did love this, until around 2 hours ago!<br><br>I only use it for frozen chips.  I hate oven chips cooked in a conventional oven, but cook them in the Airfryer and they taste so much better.<br><br>It is not as good as a traditional deep fat fryer for home made chips, but then it's hardly using any oil so it's not likely to be.<br><br>For meat etc, I find that it does the same as a George Forman grill - it cooks the food but puts a hard crispy coating on the outside.  You don't necessarily want this with a chicken breast or pork chop.<br><br>However, for quick chips from frozen this is a great product.<br><br>Ours is about a year old.  Today I pulled out the tray to shake it while coking chips.  The handle let go of the base, which fell onto my foot and the kitchen floor!  I think I broke a toe, and certainly need 2 new kitchen floor tiles!  It could have been so much worse though with the risks of burning - especially if my child had been close by!<br><br>The impact has also damaged the base - it now doesn't fit into the airfyer unit properly.<br><br>I'm very concerned that this product has failed in such a way - not electrically as I might expect, but in an very unsafe way!  I shall contact Philips as I want a refund, and replacement tiles at the very least.  I would also like to know that this can't happen again!"
"Am really impressed with this.  Have been looking at Actifry for ages, but this one has a big basket and is very neat looking.  Chips are lovely cooked in it, as are breaded chicken and even jacket potatoes.  Little cook book came with it and apparently you can make cakes in it!  Shall be experimenting over the Christmas break!<br>Makes a noise when you use it - not overbearing though.<br>Easy to wash."
"I was somewhat sceptical about this gadget but my waistline dictated that I make some changes and so I bought this.  I spent some time looking at the various options and went for this as it looked smart, had a smaller footprint and as far as I could see they all do pretty much the same so it came down to looks rather than function.  I have cooked chips twice; chunky ones and skinny ones. They are not the same as deep fried chips but there is really nothing that you could not like about them.  I think that the type of potato used is more important than with the old deep fry machine; for one thing without the fat you can really taste the potato.  I bought some Maris Piper from the market and they crisped up very nicely and tasted great."
"This was given to me for Christmas 2013, and I have been using it solidly for a year now.<br><br>All in this is a fabulous bit of kit, gone are the days of limp soggy oven chips... now you can have fries at home as if they came from your favourite clown based fast food franchise!<br><br>If you are buying frozen oven chips then they cook beautifully straight from the freezer, but if you are making your own, there is a bit more work involved but they are fantastic!<br><br>well worth the money, I just wish my wife had opted for the larger, digitally timed version!"
"As I understand it, the definition of frying involves heat source and foodstuff separated by nothing but oil or fats. To me the Airfryer is a very small fan-assisted oven, most certainly not a fryer. This was bought for me - at my request - as a Christmas present. I used it purely for making chips for eleven months, when it emitted a puff of smoke and gave up the ghost. The quality of the chips was tolerable, depending on the type of potatoes I used. It took about 4 minutes to warm up and a further 30 minutes to 'fry' the chips. The two benefits to using this gadget were relatively oil-free chips and a vapour-free kitchen.<br><br>I replaced the broken Airfryer with a cheap deep fat fryer, which takes 8 minutes to warm up and just 10 minutes to FRY the chips. Okay, the kitchen is full of vapours but the chips taste just as chips should: nice and crispy."
"GOOD"
"great service from seller, bit of a pricey product - but works well"
"Only thing is ended up eating more oven fries as tastes like fried chips. Home made chips are not bad, but not as nice as fried. Also cooked fish cakes and similar to a nice crisp"
"I'm really impressed by this unit. Yes you can use your oven. But this is designed to cook chips and other small items, it's not a generalist device. And it works. All with a half-teaspoon of oil. So chips come out healthy and crunch and yummy.<br><br>My wife and I are both dieting so it's nice to be able to have the option for chips without having the penalty of all that unhealthy oil.<br><br>Thoroughly recommend this product.<br><br>The only issue I have is unlike the tefal one this will not stir for you. Do you have to take the basket out and give it a goo shake a few times during the cooking process. With skinny chips it's better to use a spoon as well so you can really separate them out."
"Haven't fully fathomed it yet but seems ok"
"The unit was a lot larger than I expected. I've only tried chips to date but good results & no smell of the oil as you would get from a chip pan.<br>Would recommend"
"I have been considering a Tefal Actifry for over a year now. I mentioned this to a colleague who said the lid and paddle had some issues so I decided to see what alternatives there were. I've been a massive fan of Tefal I have the 4 in one Tefal slow cooker so I admit I was pretty disappointed.<br><br>I researched on customer reviews and countless utube videos I decided to get the Philips as I used to have a Philips juicer and it lasted for ages. Amazon was the cheapest price it's listed for £180 on the philips uk website.<br>I got it delivered next day. It was out of the box rinsed and switched on to use in less than 2 mins. First up chicken sausages and smiley faces no oil required. Done in 8 minutes. Normally I defrost and then heat my grill to very high to get the same effect. The box did look massive the actual size is ideal for a small kitchen. It came with a quick guide a recipe book with a helpful section at the back showing cooking times, temperatures and food types. It came with a chip guide also.  You do have to open the cooking drawer to give it a shake to prevent food from sticking at the bottom.<br>There are two dials at the front the timer (max time 30 mins) and the temperature (max temp 200). The drawer handle opens and there is your fryer tray the rest of the drawer is a drip tray non stick easy to clean. There is a button which easily releases from the drawer to load/unload food. My only gripe is the wire fryer insert could have been made more robust. I have tried to make a variety of foods before leaving a review and well I'm so impressed I'm tempted to purchase a second one. Now size I have to say if you have a family of 3+ get the XL one. For my family size it's fine. My daughter can be a fussy eater she knows what she likes and what she doesn't but this has been a hit with her too. Bonus.<br>The fryer is fast to heat up fast to cook in and it may take you some time to adjust cooking times to your preferred crispiness etc.<br>I have cooked all kinds of frozen foods in minutes. Homemade wholewheat samosa's, homemade healthy fried chicken, whole roast chicken. I would say due to the high heat cooking for fried chicken pieces soak in buttermilk or yogurt overnight it tenderises and leaves the chicken juicy inside even though you airfry it at such a high heat. Don't use vinegar/acidic marinades/lemon in any yogurt marinade it can dry out/toughen chicken. For the whole roast this doesn't require as high a heat with skin on brine overnight with rock salt water drain and leave to dry for a day in the fridge. Rub a little olive oil on the skin rock salt and chuck the whole thing in the fryer.  Fries are the best I've had for a long time.  I haven't owned an oil fryer for years so I have been using my oven.<br>It is faster than my fan assisted oven.<br>I have ordered the baking accessory from the uk Philips website as it was a wee bit cheaper than amazon. I'd like to try out a few more Recipes sweet and savoury. There are plenty of online Recipes I don't feel you need any airfryer cooking books.  I have attached some pictures on my review as to some of the foods I have cooked. It's made dinner times a lot quicker and easier than before. I was worried about the warping I read on one review but it seems it was 2 years ago and haven't felt it overheat etc. It must be an issue that's now resolved. I wanted a product that is going to last and I feel it was well worth the money. As we speak my tandoori chicken is marinating in the fridge for tomorrow's dinner '<br><br>Finally Cleaning it isn't a problem if you have a dishwasher you clean out the drip try and the fryer attachment which I have to admit is a pain as I don't have a dishwasher. I don't want oil stains on the fryer attachment so I soak it through and have to scrub it trying to be careful of the surrounding non stick container.  It's well designed and a sturdy machine one that's been made to last.  I use it 3/4 times a week.<br><br>Other than that it's an amazing wee machine. Can't wait to bake my first cake in it! Muffins in 12 minutes apparently!"
"Brilliant bit of kitchen kit. We have used everyday since we got it. Cooks very quickly and its super easy to use."
"I had heard great things about air fryers but they were very expensive. Was contemplating the cheaper Breville model but the reviews were not great so since I had a voucher I bit the bullet and its been a great investment. Chips, whilst not tasting deep fat fried, still taste a whole lot better than their oven equivalent and with only a small amount of oil it is fantastic!<br><br>We have been rather hesitant so far in our approach and only cooked chips and chicken strips in this but it cooked them perfectly. Is quick and easy and gives everything that lovely fried crispyness without the greasyness of deep fat frying. It is a rather indulgent purchase as it is not exactly needed but we could not be without one now!<br><br>There is only 2 slight cons that we have come across, the first being that is is quite noisy. Sounds quite like a hairdryer but not quite as loud. Second con is that you have to shake some foods quite frequently. I know some of the other models have a tilt which does this for you which would be very handy. I find that especially with chips, if you do not shake them every 5 mins or so they do not cook evenly."
"This has been great so far. The chips I have cooked from real potatoes are as good as can be expected when you use so little oil; chrisp on the outside and fluffy inside. Roast potatoes were as good as my oven ones. The chicken wings were better that barbeque; sticky with just the right amount of charring to the sweet sauce. Yum Yum! ribs and scampi to try next."
"I bought this as a replacement for an actifry. I will try to keep this easy to read all comparisons are with the actifry.<br><br>In favour<br>1. It has a smaller footprint.<br>2. It is quieter<br>3. It is more versatile i.e. it can be used as a small oven<br>4. It is easier to clean.<br>5. Save on electricity (see below) by not using a full size oven.<br><br>Concerns<br><br>1. Basket construction - longevity<br>2. Flavour of chips.<br><br>Tips<br><br>1. If your chips don't cook evenly or have burnt ends/uneven cooking. Turn the temperature to 160 and shake the chips 2 or 3 times. They may take a few minutes longer to cook.<br><br>2. You can safely reheat pies/sausage rolls/chinese starters/bread rolls. Roast sausages-chicken-etc. In fact anything you can do in a standard oven you can do in this machine. Obviously subject to size.<br><br>3. Experiment don't give up, use the temperature control/timer to adjust cooking to your liking. Just as you would a new oven.<br><br>I love this machine and hope you will too."
"in a few short words its better buy this one, chips made from scratch with a teaspoon of oil really fast and they come out with a crispy outer, unlike others that come out mashed and burnt<br>the speed this cooks with is awsome crispy chicken wings and nuggets , great for snacks of all kinds. a lovely Design ,it sits nicely on the work surface .the sides get warm in operation but there is almost no heat from the bottom and it stands really stable on the work surface on large rubber feet. the rack gets a bit stuck up with food but just leave it to soak and no problem Cleaning it , this is definately a keeper for my house and it will not be consigned to the dark reaches of the cupboard like my other one."
"I've used the other most-quoted alternative to this - in fact I've used it a lot and was generally very happy with it, until I got tired of the amount of time it took to work, the brutal battering it tended to hand out to innocent food and the finicky disassembly required for cleaning. So it got retired.<br><br>The Philips AirFryer has addressed each of my complaints about that other product.<br><br>My first batch of chips (lightly par-boiled and reasonably chunky) cooked at 200o for 25 minutes weren't perfect. I gave them a shake twice during cooking to stop them sticking together and they came out okay, but a little over-browned - necessary to get them to cook through.<br><br>My second batch was also quite chunky, cooked at 180o for about half an hour with a vigorous shake three times during cooking. Perfection. Honestly some of the nicest chips I've had and relatively guilt free.<br><br>I think the instructions aren't doing the device any favours by claiming you only need to shake the chips at the half-way mark as this appears to be what causes most people's dissatisfaction with the AirFryer.<br><br>I'm a total convert now. It's also very handy for reheating and cooking ready meals that would normally go in the oven. Have also used it with sausage, burgers and chicken fillets, coated and uncoated. I usually get away with giving the basket a quick wipe and putting the tray in the dish washer. Couldn't be simpler.<br><br>It's a pity about the price"
"As I've said, this does everything I'd expected it to do.  I just love it.  After a lot of research looking at both the Tefal and the Philips I decided on the Philips because it takes up less workspace than the Tefal and the price was better.  I have a small kitchen and appliances that get used regularly stay on the work top so it had to look good too.  A visitor came into the kitchen and said \"where is it then\" so it does fit in.<br><br>The cooking part - I wanted to be able to cook all sorts of stuff but not necessarily chips and this is where this shouldn't really be called a fryer because the list I wanted to cook includes crouisants, chicken, very low fat sausages and some other stuff.  My normal oven takes about 20 minutes to heat up and then six minutes to cook the crouisant.  The air fryer took a total of 8 minutes from start to finish.  The sausages have almost no fat in them and can easily take 15/20 minutes in a pan on the hob.  The air fryer had them cooked perfectly in 10 minutes.  Both at much reduced temperatures than the oven, too.  These are just a couple of examples of the things that you can do with this machine.  There are many more things that can be cooked including those chips and potatoes but as in all cooking, the timing and temperatures are rarely exact.  For instance, the crouisants recommended temperature is 200 degrees for six minutes.  The air fryer turns out to be 160 degrees for six minutes.  So the thing to do is cook it till it's ready (take it out and have a look) and don't necessary stick rigidly to the times and temperatures.<br><br>This purchase will be used a lot.  I JUST LOVE IT."
"Hi nice unit, good construction for easy Cleaning, but was expecting the internal separator for split cooking & some Accessories.<br><br>Most important unit should of been fitted with on / off power switch, poor by Philips.<br><br>Warning: if timer set for too long do not disconnect under load.."
"My 5 stars is based on this fryer being half of it's original price, I actually got it at 40% of it's original price a few months ago.<br><br>This is a great fryer and while we use it for all sorts of items like chips (straight from potatoes), bacon, sauages it's great that you don't need to cook them with additional oil.<br><br>Easy to use and quick to cook the only negative is the size of the frying section itself. We are a family of four and it's just about big enough. A larger family may find it too small.<br><br>It's also easy to clean the frying section in the dishwasher.<br><br>5 Stars."
"Yes, the price is steep for a kitchen gadget like this. But I think it is worth the investment especially if you like fried foods once in a while.<br><br>This gadget essentially use the same techology as a turbo broiler. I opted for this is because I live in an apartment and I dont need the size of a turbo broiler to make food just for two people. Its size fits the counter top like a normal sized coffee maker.<br><br>I used it to make parmesan chicken tenders and reheat fried chicken so far. The chicken tenders were lightly sprayed with Pam, and they came out tender, juicy and crispy! Store bought left over fried chicken tastes good and freshly cooked with 10mins heating time.<br><br>Pre-heating is only 3 mins for 350F which is a great time saver compared to preheating an oven.<br><br>Clean up is also a breeze. I'm excited to make some sweet potato fries this weekend."
"Been looking at the low-fat type of fryers for years.  The appeal was obvious: delicious fried food without the guilt.<br><br>None seemed to fit the bill - based on reviews all the low-fat fryers were flawed in some way.  Food was mushed by the paddle, smelly, hard to clean.  So kept passing.<br><br>Then I read about this little gadget on a European recipe site.  They have been around for a while, but had skipped the US for some reason, until now.<br><br>Hundreds of reviews were almost all 5 out of 5.  OK: now I will get one.<br><br>WOW!  easy to use, easy to clean and, finally, guilt free fried food.  Made Recipes from the included book - then made some from online.  With one exception (the use of tapioca starch on a fried chicken leg which made it taste powdery) the results have been as advertised.  Look for air fried chicken chop - it is fantastic.  No oil used at all - best fried chicken we have ever had.<br><br>French fries with 1 Tbs oil?  My result was good but not great - suspect I am still learning its clever little ways.  Will try that again soon and, now I have used it quite a few times, the process of french fries will come easier.<br><br>The device is tall - had to clear a storage space for it.  Other than that it is a device that I can recommend without reservations!"
"Great addition to the kitchen.  I fried raw chicken in 16 minutes and it was perfect. Crispy and tasty. Fish sticks - 3 minutes and biscuits in 4 minutes . Quick, healthy and well worth the money."
"I was given a Philips airfryer as a gift, and could not return it fast enough. The food comes out just about as crispy as if you were to bake it in the oven (not very), it is an absolute beast in terms of countertop/storage space, and on top of all of that, it's a nightmare to clean. With the amount of time it takes to clean the basket, I could have eaten something deliciously deep-fried, worked it off on the elliptical, and STILL had time to spare."
"Right out of the box this did exactly as I had hoped. The bottom of the ben where you put your food is made of metal mesh so to prevent sticking just spray with cooking oil such as PAM, or brush over with some type butter or oil to prevent any sticking then Cleaning will be a breeze. I have had mine for a month and find excuses to use it. If something like fries don't come out as crispy as you want (I have never had that problem, I saw a complaint about this somewhere else) turn it down a little and cook them longer. I always make frozen sweet potato fries in this which are a disaster to bake, even worse in the microwave but, with the airfryer they consistently come out crunchy on the outside and just right on the inside. Very professional. The footprint is exactly as you can imagine in the pictures, not any larger than some stand mixers but round instead of oblong. It's about 12\" tall by 9\" long, I'm trying to measure a round object for counter space.  We haven't even used oil on most things we tried as suggested, yet, everything still came out great. I want everyone to love their Airfryer as much as we do. Just use common sense and maybe experiment a little to get the results you want. Enjoy!"
"I loved fried food but worry about my weight so when I heard this way selling off the shelves in Japan I rushed to get one to try out.  Searched long to find something that cooked up well.  Eggplant and frozen burritos but you have to par cook the burritos to defrost before cooking.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  This was a complete waste of my money, this is my first review ever and it is to warn others not to purchase this item.  Food can be prepared much more flavor fully by other methods other than cooking with a hair dryer."
"For healthier dining I purchased this item (from other online retailer).  So far I am happy with Potato wedge fry, and chicken Karaage fry(Karaage is: cut up chicken pieces coated with powder spices, and deep fried). With a little bit of help such as oil spray, it came out crispy and I am happy with the outcome.  Four star is because I only have tried these two dishes.  I am motivated to try more dishes.  A bit costly but it was totally worth it.  Bottom mesh is not Teflon coated so it is a bit of work to clean depending on what you cook in it.  For Cleaning ease, I am planning to place Teflon coated mesh sheet (not to block its air flow) at bottom before start cooking and see how it works.<br><br><update> Teflon mesh sheet: Placed at basket bottom as planned and it worked just fine. Good outcome.<br><br><more update=\"\"> Dry batter (such as bread crumbs, starch flour) does not come out well even spraying oil sparsely. It does not come out as \"deep fried\" wet look. Dry flour comes out as white patch.  I learned that batter must be \"wet\".  Still I like this AirFryer.</more></update>"
"I purchased the Philips Airfyer from a home shopping channel.  Overall, I'm pleased with it.<br><br>Cons:  The basket is small.  If you're \"frying\" chicken, it'll hold just one large split chicken breast.  And, food does stick to the bottom of the basket.  Would have been nice if it had a non-stick coating.<br><br>Pros:  It does do a good job of \"frying.\"  I've made fried chicken, egg rolls, frozen orange chicken pieces from Trader J*oe's.  They all tasted fried.  It will hold a Cornish hen & cook it in about 30 minutes @ 320 degrees (unstuffed).  I didn't try to fry the hen - it was nicely roasted w/a crisp skin.  Everything I've cooked in the Airfryer has turned out well.  And, spraying the basket w/a non-stick spray does help prevent sticking.  The basket pieces are dishwasher safe, but they'll take a lot of room.<br><br>I would not recommend this appliance to someone cooking for a family.  But, it's fine for one or two people.  Its footprint is relatively small - about the same as my fuzzy logic rice cooker.<br><br>I think the Airfryer is an overpriced small appliance.  But, I decided to keep mine because it does make food taste fried with little oil or mess."
"My CEO is always bringing in new gadgets for our kitchen. This time he won big. I made fresh chicken in the office with this thing, no flipping, nothing and it came out no knife tender. First try, no Recipes, just guessing.<br><br>I'm sure I will find more flaws as time goes on but, this thing is quick, easy and I swear it makes amazing food. Chicken wings from scratch came out fall off the bone tender, I even made frozen chicken nuggets and they came out better than the toaster without flipping or doing anything but pressing start and throwing in handfuls. Literally that easy.<br><br>This thing is stupid proof and produces good food. One of the first new kitchen gadgets in a while that has impressed me. I'm basically air frying everything in my freezer and fridge for a week now. Doesn't need to be fried? It does now!<br><br>I bet this would make amazing salmon too. I mean you can make real food with this. I keep seeing comments on frozen junk, which trust me I'm using it for but, I made food from scratch that I couldn't of made better in my home kitchen and I did it on a counter at work.<br><br>It's worth it if this suits your style. You can feed a COUPLE people, not a huge family. It's quick and effortless. I just fed the whole office chicken wings, made 2 batches rapid fire. Don't buy this thing thinking it's anything other than it is and you will be 100% happy I guarantee it."
"My first thought when I initially bought this was one of apprehension. I did not know if this product really will live up to it's somewhat hefty price tag. Now I use this gem almost everyday. Even dishes I used to do in the oven I do in the air fryer now mainly because of it's speed.<br><br>About the only thing that I could see it improving is the dish or the compartment size which is rather limited now and an easier casing to disassemble and wash. Washing is quite a chore now. Aside from that this device is just perfect for me to dump food in it and return about 20 minutes later to almost perfectly fried dishes all the time."
"I believe you 'get what you pay for', so I bought this one instead of the one half this price.  I've used it three times in the two weeks I've had it, and it does just what it says (which is what I want).  I've made fried calamari, fried oysters, and chicken tenders.  I love 'fried' food once in a while, but I wanted 'healthier', with easier clean up.  Who wants to dispose of the oil after making a calamari appetizer??<br>I can see that you have to experiment a bit with different foods to get the right fry time. For my calamari, it was about 12 min. (these were breaded raw, not reheat type)and were crispy and perfect. I think that's about half the time of getting oil hot and deep frying them, and avoiding the hot oil spatter!!  The oysters were the same, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.  Chicken tenders are faster to make b/c they are partially cooked.  I think it's a win/win/win; easy to prepare, easy to clean up, and healthier for you overall."
"This is not a replacement for frying, but it is the closest attempt that I've tried.  The only thing that it lacks is the oil flavor.  It basically is a convection oven that bakes your food.  If all you care about is the taste of real fried food, than you'll probably want to stick to a deep fryer.  If you are willing to sacrifice a little bit of oil flavor for a whole lot of Health benefit, than this is a good way to do it.  For us, who like a balance between Health and taste, this is a really great product.  We love it and highly recommend it."
"I just got back from visiting family in Australia and noticed that \"airfryers\" are in nearly every household. From what I've observed over the years, Australians seem to be more Health conscious than we are here in the US (smaller portion sizes, eat seasonally, no growth hormones in dairy and meat, fewer preservatives in packaged foods, etc) anyway, they still love to eat, drink and celebrate with food like everyone else on the planet. So they find work-arounds ... enter air fryers. You can give your kids home made chicken nuggets and fries that taste as good as what you would purchase at any fast food chain (even better actually) and do it all at home and eliminate the deep fryer.<br><br>This is an EXCELLENT unit that is well made, looks great, and really lasts (my in-laws and several friends have had theirs for a couple of years with no problems.) It sells for a lot less in Australia (go figure, virtually everything else retails for more) but this tells you it's a great seller over there. I've done the research, you can buy this item directly from Philips USA and pay $249, free shipping OR you can go online to HSN and buy it for $200, free shipping, and if you sign up for email advertisements HSN will send you a 15% off coupon brining the unit price to $170 ... how great is that???<br><br>So while I normally do most of my home and personal shopping on Amazon, this time around I'll be visiting the HSN web site and ordering this product from them for a lot less."
"I just looked at this appliance on the manufacturer's web site. The seb site shows a much lower retail price than what I am seeing here at Amazon. What's up with that? Why charge fifty dollars more than the suggested retail price???<br>Viva Collection Airfryer<br>•Low fat fryer<br>•Multicooker<br>•Black<br>(26)<br>HD9220/26<br>$249.99*"
"I am continually shocked how well the Philips HD9220 Viva Collection Airfryer works. It is built like a tank although very easy to use. In fact, it couldn't get much easier. Just pick the temperature and set the timer and walk away. I am still going through some advanced calculus to master some premade frozen items like quesadillas to come out correctly. I have found if you cut the \"Conventional Oven\" time on the package in half the items usually cook crispy and far better than the mush I get from the same items in the microwave.  Fries are only the beginning as this unit does everything I put in it well. I was going to get one of the other air fryers but figured I'd spend the extra coin because of the ratings. I am glad I did. Many items I used to NUKE or pan fry I now use this device for and the results are fantastic."
"Potatoes cooked from scratch in this machine come out greaseless, yes, but dry & more like roasted potatoes than french fries. Lash on the ketchup, and they seem OK, I guess. Frozen fries fare better, but they have been deep-fried already, so there is no calorie savings there.<br><br>Doughnuts  came out looking like bagels, and were too dry to eat.<br><br>This appliance cooks and dries your food. It works the way a convection oven works, with perhaps more intense air movement. The trade-off is small portions.<br><br>I think there are only a few limited things this appliance is good at - frozen fries being the most useful. For the limited counter space I have, this did not add enough additional functionality over and above a convection oven to be worth it to me - and a convection oven is more generally useful."
"I got this bad boy following a recommendation from a friend. I really like it. I tried Fries, frozen foods and chicken wings so far, worked like a charm. What I like best is that unlike a deep fryer, the house doesn't smell like burnt oil after several uses.<br>I do recommend it."
"First things first. This is not a fryer but a mini convection oven and it performs similarly to other convection ovens, majority of which are far more versatile and are selling for less.<br><br>I got mine as a gift. It is the version that sells in Canada and it does not come with food separator or baking dish. With retail price over $200, you'd expect these things to be included.<br><br>How well does it perform? It makes decent baked fries in about 20-25 mins. The results do not compare to a deep fryer in terms of taste, but then this appliance should be compared to other convection ovens and not to deep fryers. While baking is healthier than deep frying, the notion of \"guilt-free chips/fries\" is fallacious as the main problem with potatoes in general is their starch content. It breaks down into sugar and messes up your brain receptors that signal you to stop eating because you're full. I can't believe people still fall for this low fat nonsense. If you're watching your weight, you should be more concerned about grains and sugar.<br><br>Other items I tried in it were salmon fillets (about 10 mins, results identical to baking salmon in conventional oven) and raw sausages (10 mins, again, same as baked). With raw sausages, right at the end of the cooking cycle, the smoke coming out of the back became very intense and set off my smoke detector. It's a good idea to keep an eye on your foods if they have higher fat content.<br><br>Don't expect to feed a crowd using this convection oven. It will cook enough food to feed 2-3 people. 4+ means you have to cook in batches so the time savings go out of the window, you're better off using your conventional oven.<br><br>The appliance is mostly hard plastic. It feels solid. Cooking basket is metal with some type of Teflon/non-stick coating. Cleaning has been problem-free so far. Similar to any other non-stick pan.<br><br>A special shout-out goes to the Philips marketing dept:<br><br>1) \"Air Fryer\" is an oxymoron. Dictionary defines frying as cooking in oil. \"Air frying\" and \"rapid air technology\" are known as convection baking outside the Philips headquarters. There is nothing \"revolutionary\" about them.<br><br>2) \"Healthy\", \"healthier\" and \"guilt-free\" is plastered all over the box. Healthier than what? Deep fryers? Sure. Other convection ovens? No.<br>*Speaking of \"healthy\". Philips conveniently does not mention whether the basket's Teflon coating contains toxic materials or whether the plastics in close proximity to food contain BPA.<br><br>3) \"Oil free cooking\" is an outright lie and one of the Philips ads mentioning it was banned in the UK. Their excuse was that frozen packaged chips/fries already have oil in them so it doesn't count. By that logic, I can enjoy oil free cooking in my cast-iron frypan if I get somebody else to put in there. Brilliant! Not that there's anything wrong with adding good Quality and healthy olive oil to your baked food.<br><br>In conclusion, it is very hard to recommend this small convection oven at this price point. You are far better off spending $100-150 on a larger and more versatile convection oven from Cuisinart, Breville or Panasonic. Or, if you're comfortable with slightly longer cooking times, just stick with your conventional oven. It \"air fries\" your food just as well.<br><br>*Extra star taken off for deceptive marketing.<br><br>**It turned out to be difficult to find objective reviews of this product on the web. The majority appear to be disguised advertisements. I added the links I found to be most useful in my research in a comment below my review."
"The AirFryer sounds sort of gimmicky but I think of it as a mini convention oven with some advantages.<br>It is easy to clean, requires no start up time, and delivers a lower fat alternative to fried foods. It comes with a cooking manual which is for the most part helpful and accurate, but it also depends a bit on trial and error. You may have to add additional time by a minute or two if you are making large chicken breasts or extra thick pork chops. It also won't make food in large batches but can handle a small family's needs.<br>Frozen french fries aren't particularly impressive, but if you dredge them in a couple of tablespoons of cooking oil and turn on the unit the results are surprisingly good. My advice is to experiment in small increment and use the oil sparingly as needed. This does an excellent job on frozen chicken tenders and pre-made onion rings. For the most part I use frozen foods because convenience is my middle name, but you can also do made from scratch fried foods with decent results from the cook book.<br>One important thing to note is you shouldn't reuse oil because it gets rancid and/or retains particles from old oil and will make the oil less than appealing and it may also smoke.<br>I purchased this from a shopping network and paid less by fifty or more dollars. After a few months of use I still have yet to encounter any problems with the AirFryer.<br>I like it because it is a healthier alternative to oil saturated fried food and is quick and convenient. It is less messy than conventional frying and cleanup is easy compared to conventional deep frying."
"Like one of the previous users stated this is not a FRYER by ANY means. This is a shady and over priced mini convection oven and if you look at a the recopies… you are STILL adding oil. Maybe you’re not saturating it in oil as you would in a deep fryer but my convection oven is just as good if not better. I have given it a fair chance… making fries, chicken wings, catfish, ground beef and o few other things. My side-by-side comparison with the KitchenAid countertop oven that I got from Target for $79.99 and THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE in the end result as well as the time it takes to cook. So, after reading the reviews and taking it upon myself to still order thinking this was some magic that missed the USA… No, its just a sheik re-invention of the old 1891’s conventional oven. I will be sending back."
"Think about it carefully.... fired food is the tastiest way to cook, but we all know all those oils aren't very good for us.  here's a way to get that fried taste and fried texture without having really fry it.  that's amazing in my book.<br><br>So here are the facts:<br><br>1. It is like having your food lightly fried.  don't think this can replace deep frying.<br>2. you use a table spoon of oil at most.<br>3. the tray inside is quite small (maybe 6 x 6 x 4 inches - i think).<br>4. perfect for fries etc.<br>5. it's convenient and easy to clean.  no mess and no big clean up.<br><br>i think this is a fantastic product and is easy to use.<br><br>by far any way it has been a christmas gift I received that was a surprise and that I'm happy with."
"I have had this product for about 1 week now, and am overall pleased with my purchase. I've read multiple reviews prior to purchasing and knew what I was getting into prior to its arrival, and was able to try a few things out to make my own conclusions. Also there are many more reviews from the UK/Australia, but I use the US version and have cooking times in farenheit etc.<br><br>Things you need to know:<br>1. This item is best suited to cook frozen fries and other frozen foods. It does this job well. The fries taste similar to what can be done from a deep fryer, and definitely better then a regular conventional oven (though I dont use \"convection baking\", so I cant speak to its comparison with convection)<br><br>2. Its built well and easy to clean up. Compared to deep frying, there is a night and day difference. No mess, minimal smell (as much as normal cooking)<br><br>3. Its size is not as big as people may make you think, its smaller than a Kitchenaid mixer. Also in terms of noise, its not silent but if you are alone without background noise (music or TV), there is the noise of the fan which is noticeable, but not a problem<br><br>4. This is ideal for 1-2 up to 3 people for snacks. You cannot feed a family without doing multiple batches. The amount of fries that can be cooked at one time seems to be the same as two medium orders at a fast food chain.<br><br>What I have cooked:<br>Frozen fries - great, as advertised<br><br>Frozen samosas (Indian savory pastry) - initially turned out ok initially without any manipulation, but brushed with some olive oil prior to cooking and turned out great, similar to frying<br><br>Frozen popcorn chicken - great<br><br>Fresh Chicken wings - this is what sold me on this machine. Just take fresh wings from the grocery store and brush with some olive oil, cook for 18 minutes on 350-390 with a shake half way, plate and pour on your favorite warmed wing sauce. Definitely as good as doing it in the deep fryer in terms of crisp on on the outside and tender inside, superior to baking as well (conventional baking). However, this does create some smoke but if you pour out the oil (the extra oil just from the chicken itself that comes from cooking) at the time you shake you will avoid the smoke. This makes 8 wings easily, could probably make 12 easily as well without stacking. and I am also thinking of getting the layering rack when the price goes down.<br><br>In regards to home made fries - i have not tried this, and it seems like it would be time consuming based off the various Recipes because of all the soaking etc that you need to do. Also wet batters dont seem like they would work well in this either.<br><br>Overall, I think this is a good product and best suited for 1-2 people who are looking for easy ways to cook frozen foods that turn out as good and way less oil compared to deep frying, and would be great for kids who want to eat frozen foods and maintain that high Quality crunch. Some foods you cannot substitute for deep frying, and there is a whole range of items of fresh foods that I have not tried yet due to time constraints. However, the price point remains high for this product, and think that it would sell better if it was around $150.<br><br>Feel free to ask my questions etc, and am excited to see all the various items I can make in this machine. Essentially it can work as a toaster or small oven as well, but I have not used it for this purpose yet."
"I was skeptical when I saw this on HSN (it was a daily special for $179.99 + SH), since I was able to break up the payments I decided on a whim to get it. If I didn't like it, I could return it no problem and only be out SH. I just recently got this and as other have mentioned, it was larger than I originally expected. Like a very big oversized coffee maker but its light and very easily to move. The electric cord also is self contained in the bag of the machine.<br><br>This machine is so easy to use, I can't believe it. It also cooks food so well. The first night I made chicken nuggets and french fries. I stuck to the serving sizes on the packages and the meal was only 320 calories! The food was equally as crispy as our local bar snacks and I didn't use a drop of oil or butter! I couldn't believe it. I was really impressed and can't believe how easy it is to clean it too! One small negative comment I would say is that I put the nuggets at the bottom of the basket and when I tried to remove them, a small bit of breading got stuck between the holes. That is really the only small complaint I have. Overall this thing cooks/air fries awesome! I'm really pleased with my purchase.<br><br>There are only two adults in my household, so this size is perfect. If you have more members in your family, this might be too small but I'd say for two-four people, its perfect!<br><br>The only reason I gave it four stars versus five is because to get the full value out of the machine, due to the price, you have to buy several other Accessories. These of course are rather expensive and proprietary to Philips, so they lost a star for that."
"Used twice already. Meat was really great but the fries were not what I expected. Maybe the kind of potatoes plays a role on this."
"This is the best appliance ever. I read that Europeans use it like we use microwaves. This is so much more healthier and foods come out great. I don't understand why stores don't carry it here in the USA. (well, maybe I do)"
"It met all my expectations. I would recommended to friends and family. And I have already recommended to all relatives."
"I think this is not worth to buy. The food does not taste like fried, it is more like baked and it takes a lot of counter space. I have returned it."
"Cuisine that does not use oil is good.<br>Unlike a microwave oven, time is taken, but it is finished in a crunch.<br>I think price is a little high."
"When I first reviewed this I liked it very much and pointed out it had many more uses than just french fries. In particular I said most frozen breaded food like chicken nuggets, breaded fish, etc. came out perfectly from a frozen state. I have since had excellent results using it on fresh food from everything to raw chicken to breaded raw pork chops. The key think to keep in mind is not to cook raw food with enough fat in it to start dripping. I cook very thick pork chops by coating in flour and browning on my cooktop. But if I leave them on the cooktop the flour will burn before the center is cooked. Once the chops or fish or chicken is browned enough, not real brown, I transfer them to the hot pot for about 8-10 minutes depending on thickness. Of course this is the same as putting them in a preheated oven but this way there is no preheating and the turbo fast hot air makes the coating even crisper without browning it further.The big limitation is size. I am only cooking for one or two but if you are cooking for four or more you will have to use your oveb. I have also had good luck with raw fish, chicken breasts, etc. without a lot of fat by nust seasoning it and putting it in the fryer for 10 minutes or so. If you season it and spray a little Pam or olive oil on it it will come out browned and juicy on the inside since the shuper hot fast moving air will put a nice brown crust on it. Now back to original review.<br><br>Hot air fryers are fairly new in the US. When I set out to buy one there was only one available on amazon and it was not the Phillips so I bought a less expensive model that was OK but when I finally to buy a Phillips I did (for $320). Most of the ones available then were not name brands and not available on amazon. The difference between a hot air fryer and a convection oven is the turbo speed it passes the hot air over the food.  If you leave your blow fryer on your head for an extra 10 seconds without moving it you will get the idea. It does cook fries almost as good as deep frying (you are missing the delicious oil) but it cooks almost any frozen breaded food like fish, chicken pieces, shrimp, etc. It also cooks many fresh foods like fish, seafood, etc.You need to look at the cookbook to get ideas. I have not put any raw fatty foods like a hamburg in it but I have cooked lean steaks. If you are mainly interested in fries the main competitor is the actifry which I have had for years. The actifry will also cook other foods but they have to be small to tumble over the turner hump and they burn easily since it only has one temperature-hot.<br>  There are over 300 reviews for the avtifry so you have all you need to know about actifry. It is an innovative product that will cook many different foods you would normally fry at hot temp. while stirring. You don't need to stir with the actifry but you do need to keep an eye on it since it is high temp. only and it is easy to burn foods. For deep frying french fries it is a great alternative but has not had any competition until now. The hot air fryers (not pots) are becoming available and popular right now and also make french fries without deep frying. There are many opinions on the internet about which are better, split about 50/50 on fries. But the new (to the US) hot air fryers also do many things besides fries. They have a basket much like a deep fryer so do not stir the food. But you can put large food like a chicken breast, frozen or not, breaded or not, and get excellent results. Almost any breaded meat or fish can be cooked to perfection. It takes a while to figure out the timing. Best of all it has a temperature control so if you are not trying to get the deep fried look like on unbreaded fish, you can turn the temp. down and get fried fish. So which is better? If you have food no larger than french fries that need high heat and constant stirring to keep from burning the actifry is usually the best. If you have large pieces of meat, fish, etc. you can't put them in an actifry but the hot air fryer will do an excellent job. I rate both 5 stars and since they are about the same for fries but otherwise cook different types of food you need both! If the pieces are small and need stirring the actifry is the way to go. Disadvantage is no temperature control.<br>  Foods larger than fries cook in the hot air fryer. It cannot hold as much food as the actifry but is adequate and the only option for larger food you would fry or deep fry but are too big for the actifry. Notice the actifry has come down in price since it was introduced. But it was patented so had no rivals. The hot air fryers are made by many although the Phillips was the first one I saw. It cost $320 a month ago. There are 3 alternatives on amazon now ranging from $150 to $250. Amazon also has the best price on the actifry. So go crazy and order both. They will greatly cut down your time in the kitchen and do not heat the kitchen up. I live alone so I prepare the food, put the entree in the hot air fryer, the side dish in the actifry and maybe one other dish in the microwave. Then I watch TV until dinner is done in about 10 minutes for most meals. For the truly lazy get a fuzzy logic rice cooker as well for when you are tired of potatoes. Amazon has a nice selection. You might spend as much as $500 but your slaving over a hot stove will be over. The hot air fryers have been popular in Japan, China and Europe for a while but are new to the US.<br>SUMMARY Actifry is excellent for fries and can cook many other foods as long as they are not much bigger than fries or homes fries. The continuous stirring keeps food from burning but the high heat (about 400 degrees Is my guess) will still burn some delicate foods. Many reviewers sound like they only use it for fries which is a shame. Timing varies with the amount of food. Main disadvantage--no temperature control.<br>  Hot Air Fryer also cooks excellent fries but in my opinion the Actifry fries are slightly better. I think this is because you use a tablespoon of oil in the actifry which eventually coats all the fries and helps them brown. If you spray the fries with oil before putting them in the hot air fryer they are about the same. The hot air fryer will cook many larger foods like chicken breasts, bratwurst,whole potatoes, entree size meat and fish with or without breading although frozen breaded works best Main disadvantage--medium deep fryer size basket will not cook enough for four but you can keep the first batch in an oven set a about 150 degrees. Main advantage is a temp. control allows you to cook more delicate foods like unbreaded fish.<br>If I could only buy one, I cannot say for sure which I would buy. I do use the hot air fryer more just because so many entrees cook in it.<br>  At this price it is a real bargain and Phillips is the gold standard and the first name brand to sell in the US."
"I bought one for home and two of these guys for the office. We have a small office with 16 guys. This is by far the most used appliance, considering the fact we have a full kitchen with gas stoves, two microwaves and a toaster oven. Guys use this to fry and reheat all kinds of food, including sandwiches. This is one of the most useful products ever invented for kitchen. Only wish it comes in a larger size for big parties."
"After trying it for almost a month. I think it's really helpful and easy to use. Defiantly recommend it ."
"I bought this one for one of my daughters and she really likes it. One of my other daughters gave me one for Christmas and I LOVE it. My husband and I try to eat as little oil as possible and this helps. In fact when frying frozen french fries, I usually have some in the bottom which means that this has taken some of the grease out. I have cooked several things in it and we have enjoyed them all."
"We love our air fryer.  We have had it for about 3 months now and use it fairly regularly.  We do not have a vented hood, so we end up using it on our balcony just because we don't like our house smelling like anything we cook for a couple days.  *Note that is not a fault of this unit, just beware that it does put off some smoke - same as if you were cooking something in a skillet.  The food comes out great.  My only fault would be it is a bit small for more than 2 people.  I am thinking about buying a second just for when we have other people over.  Wings are by far our favorite.  We have never had such juicy wings, not dripping in grease, and yet still have crispy skin!  Anytime we cook meat, we do not use any oil at all and it works perfect.  Super lean meats or potatoes or veggies you need to add a teaspoon of oil...maybe.  Check out the Recipes.  Fantastic buy!!"
"It seems like fried for things pre-cooked or made for fried. I`ve tried homemade potatoes and they were not so good. It is difficult to clean as well"
"After one year, this unit has quit working.  I never would have suspected it... It just quit working.  I'll try contacting the manufacturer, but I don't feel good about this.<br><br>Well,  my fryer works fine afterall!  I had a  bad outlet!  Excellent product!"
"A friend of mine has a similar unit she bought at a big-box warehouse store, but  the footprint was HUGE- not my style, nor did I (or family members ) have space for it.<br><br>Then I saw the Philips version.... smaller footprint, around the same price, but what an elegant, and functional Design!  I admit I am a fan of most Phillips products, they put time and effort into Design, and end user satisfaction. Certainly not inexpensive, but REALLY GOOD at what it does.<br><br>I will not get into Health benefits ( or lack there of) but I can tell you it is beyond simple to use, and cooking results have been OUTSTANDING! From fast fries, to shrimp, salmon, and mozzarella sticks this is a winner!<br><br>On Television and Movie sets, we have catered food, and \"craft service\" to provide things all day( and NIGHT, sometimes). I first saw the Philips unit used on-set for a popular cable TV drama, and loved it.  I went out , and got one.<br><br>Considering the results and ease of use, I brought it to my senior parents, for a try-out.  To be fair, I did not know what to expect. Mom is almost 80, and was a sensational intuitive cook, but suffers from severe vision impairment, now. Dad is suddenly the cook ( or buyer of prepared food).<br><br>Once I explained the  product to them, there was interest.<br><br>After we cooked a few things, there was joy!  Mom, in particular liked the notion that she could prepare some of the things that were once staples - fries, mozzarella sticks, hash browns, onion rings (YEAH Mom!) with Safety and ease.  We even made \"string-bean\" fries that I saw on-set once.<br><br>Needless to say, Mom and Dad kept the unit, and are happy! I know it can be hard to get gifts for people at any age, but do consider this, as an option.  I feel this is best designed unit on the market, and it delights people. Priceless!<br><br>And, yes, after giving one to Mom and Dad , I DID get another one, for me, and almost use it daily. This is really top-of-the-line, and worth every cent. Comfort food just became EASY!<br><br>**** Update Aug 9 2014 ******<br><br>The units are still going strong and are used several times a week-- so this is not one of those \"use it a few times\" kind of things.<br><br>Terrific for \"popcorn\" shrimp and chicken! Really nice after a long day at work, and you want something good and easy to prepare. Mom and Dad love theirs too, and say they use it 4 or 5 times a week - that's outstanding!.<br><br>They even planted string beans this year to use with the Air-Fryer. De-LISH!<br><br>I come back to the ease of use, particularly for seniors (or maybe college age people?) This is a safe and reasonably healthy way to enjoy comfort food. The Philips build is great, as you would expect. I have had no problems, nor have my parents. Ultra high Quality. Just as good today, as when I bought it.<br><br>I have used this for appetizers with friends, and they are skeptical at first, and LOVING it when they taste the results. Even the \"foodies\" were impressed. GREAT product!"
"The only thing I don't understand is why this hasn't taken off in the USA sooner.  We have had ours for a few months now and everything we have tried has come out perfect.  French fries from fresh potatoes, frozen fries, sweet potato fries, and chicken wings are our favorites.  An entire batch of fries with only a teaspoon of oil and the wings don't need anything except seasoning.  One modification we do to the cooking procedure is shake the food a couple of extra times during cooking in addition to the one time suggested in the recipe booklet.  Enjoy!"
"I can get things crispy in here, but what I really use it as is a small roaster.  Great for making meals for one or two and I don't need to heat up the full size oven."
"Just love the air fryer!! Makes my life wayyyy easier since I don't have to be watching the pan anymore ...<br>And the food is just delicious, I fell like I'm using a barbecue grill... but way more practical and inside of the house!<br>I would definitely recommend this product! :)"
"My wife bought that with a simple deal, Try to eat better food, which is more heathy and keep tasted so good."
"First off I would like to start by saying I did tons of research and watched tons of videos on this product before I made this purchase. I was very excited to get it.....then I used it :( . Most of the stuff you are going to watch online is from Europe, Australia, and Asia. It looks like you can fit a lot of food in it. The reason is because their baskets overseas are bigger then the ones released in the US.  They get all the good stuff in their box like the food separator an the dish pan. We here in the US DO NOT! What you see is what you get. Just the basket, that is it, nothing else, oh well u do get the cook book but that's about it. In order to get your fries the right consistency you basically end up with somewhat burned food. Now maybe lowering the temp might help but honestly after using my actifry I didn't even want to bother with this piece of junk. ironically the pan to catch the grease is non stick but the basket is not!! I just laugh inside when I think about this, how dumb......your food will stick to the basket. Oh and the simple shake in between cooking?! kind of hard when the food is stuck to the basket. I bet they did a lot of takes to get that perfect shake on their add. Oh!!!! I tried to cook foods with a bit of fat and the darn thing started smoking out the back!!!! my smoke detectors were going off like crazy!!! I'm just not dealing with this thing. I was hoping to use it in conjunction with the actifry but nope i'm sending this thing back. Maybe the newer digital model has worked out the kinks but this model is a no no. I highly suggest you try with the newer model or get an actifry. but the thing that really upsets me is I love this concept...I was going to use this for my dry battered foods as with the actiry it stirs so batter comes off I really wish this product was made like the ones overseas. They look like they are having grand old time with their model and we get stuck with a overpriced piece of crap :(."
"I've been using this air fryer for a few months now and couldn't be happier with it. A few things to love about it:<br><br>***There's no mess. Want to \"fry\" some chicken? Any greases drip into the container itself. Just put a dab of Dawn in in, add some water and it's clean.<br>***No need to defrost. I've had chicken defrosted that I ended up eating only because I didn't want it to go bad. In the air fryer, you can put the chicken in frozen and it's just as good as if it had been defrosted.<br>***And Time: Just about anything can be fully cooked in 12 minutes, 15 tops. I've put frozen chicken wings in for 12 minutes, and they've come out fully cooked and crispy. Same with vegetables. For brussel sprouts, for example, i just give them a quick spray with olive oil, salt and pepper them, and they're ready to eat in 6-8 minutes.<br><br>Believe the hype!"
"Amazing product from Philips and it works as expected.<br>I just would like to have the temperatures in the product and in Manual in Celsius as well."
"Love it, it is worth the money and it is much healthier eating.  We have not used any oil except small amount for home made frys."
"It works especially well for roasting meat.<br>The food is made with a good taste and low fat.<br>It's realy wonderful!"
"I just think that the basket had to be basket a little bigger than it is, other then that works just fine,  it do not have the same taste as a real deep fried, but it gets real closed to it. But for who's looking for healthy life, this is going to help a lot."
"Bulky, expensive and really just bakes things. French fries have roasted taste and bakes uneven. Cooking capacity for almost all foods unless you cook for two people is small. Even for two people the capacity is low.<br><br>Not worth the price!"
"The seller is very frequently changing the price at a level much higher than is considered reasonable. I noticed price changing 3 times within 2 hrs."
"It works well as I expected. There has been no problem since I got it a month ago. It allows a healthy way of cooking."
"I am not fond of kitchen tools that have to be plugged in, but I couldn't face another five-month summer with a big antique cast iron stove that heats up my tiny kitchen.  This was a good purchase for me, and although maybe the reviewer is right who says the Breville portable convection oven is a better buy, the Breville is too big for the space I have and it costs more.  (The smallest Breville is not convection). Quibbling about whether it's really a fryer seems useless to me.  Technically the food is not fried, and that's good.  It tastes pretty close to fried and as a Southerner I'm an expert.  I have cooked several things in it now, but have not tried baking yet. Although it takes a little getting used to, it is not as tricky as a microwave and it's very forgiving.  Basically you coat the food with a teaspoon or two of oil, put it in the basket and cook it.  Air blows across it constantly.  I had wondered about foods with a batter, and it is possible to \"fry\" those also.  The batter or whatever will drip to the bottom at first, so a light coating is best. I have put oil on the food but I don't see why you couldn't cook without any.  All but the motor can go in the dishwasher but it's easy enough to swipe it out by hand as it's bulky.  I bought mine on a shopping channel so that I could try it out without committing the whole purchase price, and so far I'm glad I did.  It would not be good for a large family as the food would have to cook in batches, although it could be done.  It could be improved with a temperature monitor of some sort so I would know when it's preheated adequately and when it had heated adequately after the drawer was opened."
"Ohhh yeah this is my new best friend!!!! If it ever stops working trust me when I say I'd buy another, food tastes really bess!"
"Hey everybody! That is a really great product! I really enjoyed!"
"I ordered  one and the website information says I ordered a black one. When the box came, the machine turned out to be a white one. A little disappointment with the color but the machine itself is great."
"We have owned several home fryers and mostly make french fries.  I was skeptical about this product, but my husband found a good review for it and really wanted to try a healthier version of homemade fries.  Shake the basket during cooking for more evenly cooked fries.  I couldn't believe how crisp and delicious the fries were without much oil (just coated in a bowl before placing in the fryer).  Also, no oil to deal with and no smelly greasy odor for days.  We're very pleased and hope to eat a little healthier with this product."
"What can I say about this? One of the most AWESOME products I purchased recently. I actually couldn't believe to have french fries in 15 minutes, very crispy and with a fairly professional look, with ALMOST NO OIL!! I only used as little as a tea spoon of olive oil just to make the potato straws greasy so they do not stick to each other. I also tried making Steak, and in 9 minutes it gave the BEST steak I had ever made at home with absolutely no mess. I am really establishing a love relationship with this little device. It is a truly fantastic product by using which I can have guilt free pro-looking french fries and many other things every day! The price was a bit steep, but it was really worth to my opinion."
"I absolutely love this air fryer.  The food is so crispy, specifically chicken wings.  I love that not only are you not adding extra fat, but you can actually see the fat that you have cooked off in the bottom of the tray.  I just learned a new trick last evening too.  We got take out from a local restaurant and the French fries were soggy when we got them home from being in the polystyrene container.  I popped the fries in the air fryer for about 4 minutes and they were like brand new, straight from the fryer, French fries.  I love crispy food."
"Great for some foods and not so great for others. French fries and chicken fry well."
"excellent"
"Good product, I recommend for everybody"
"Does what it says on the tin! Makes great fries and awesome chicken. I hate deep frying food but love fries, this gadget lets me eat gorgeous crispy fries without feeling too guilty"
"Very nice, does a good job, easy to clean, cooks fast"
"Very good fryer!!!"
"I've been using air fryers since the day it was invented and love them, I feel healthier & it takes less time to cook. Works great, even comes with the original cookbook & everything looks brand new, can't tell it's refurbished & everything works well. Already used it a few times without problem, washing the tray is always a pain bc my scrub attaches to the bottom wire netting. These devices are pretty big so make sure you have enough space for storage in your pantry."
"We love this thing at home!! A little bit hard to clean but so happy with it"
"It takes more than twice the time as advertised.  Very disappointing, very expensive, very time consuming making the wonderful french fries everyone raves about. Did not think they were all that great!  The only thing good about it was that it's easy to clean."
"I use this product at least 3x a week. air fried sweet potatoes are yummy as are hot wings.  There is no mess to clean and my kitchen stays cool."
"It is working very well."
"This is an amazing product.  I was skeptical at first based on other's reviews.  But I have learned in the past that you can't make everyone happy.  We bought this just about a month ago and have made a variety of things in it.  We have made batter dipped homemade onion rings, that were really good - over cooked which was our fault - but very good. We have made store bought frozen French Fries which turned out really good and we have made homemade Lumpia (a Pilipino spring roll) in this thing.  The Lumpia was a little dry, but tasted great.  It is a little dry because it is not soaked in oil!!!  It takes time to get used to the cooking times as it is mostly trial and error... we are still figuring that out but have been very pleased.  I think people need to remember that because there is no oil, the food will taste slightly different... as in you will have the ability to actually taste the flavors of the food not the oil.  I highly recommend this as it does make crispy food with a 'soft' center. This is great for anyone who is trying to cut back on the grease, i.e. people with heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc.  Or just anyone who would like to lose weight and be healthier.<br>Do seriously consider buying the cooking rack insert, especially if you have more than 2 or 3 people in the house, it double the cooking area and works great - yes we bought that too!"
"Great for chicken and frozen fries!"
"Accessories not included"
"It works as an oil fryer, but it is better because regarding Heath, the food is incomparable!"
"Excellent product, everything I do now is without oil and the taste is wonderful. I'm delighted."
"the only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because I wish to believe that Phillips did not INTENTIONALLY put a poor product out for sale.  They're a solid company with a well-earned reputation for Quality products.  This is not one of those, in my experience.  It has a critical weak point, and until they fix that, I strongly suggest you don't buy this product.  I unpacked this brand-new item, and proceeded to explore its features.  To wash the product, you must detach the basket-handle from the basket.  I pushed on the flimsy grey plastic release button, and attempted to detach.  Nothing happened.  I applied a slight amount of torque, equal to what you would use to twist off a bottle cap from a beer bottle.  Immediately I heard a \"snap\" and noticed that the entire joint had become damaged, flopping around like a broken limb.  Seriously?  It broke, after such a slight application of force?  I examined it closely and noted that the only connecting points were tiny little plastic nubs, which had broken off. There was no illustration in the enclosed user's guide instructing how to remove the handle, whether to twist like screw, or pull up, or down. Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  The fact that this critical connecting piece is so poorly constructed of cheap plastic as to break under very little pressure gives me a feeling of little confidence in the engineering of this product.  I will look for another brand offering a similar device."
"bought it for $ 180.97 and when she put down and refer to me only 144"
"Great"
"I love Air Fryers, but not in love with this one as much as the cheap knockoff I had previously. Why?  Because this one is much tougher to clean.  I think they Philips calls it Rapid Air Technology, basically it's grooves in the bottom that are supposed to direct the air upwards.  Well, those grooves make this a pain in the butt to clean.  My previous Air Fryer, a cheap knockoff, had a flat bottom.  I notice no difference in cooking, but I find this harder to clean.  Both of them get messy inside and aren't as easy to clean as they could be, but this one is more difficult.<br><br>That being said, do I love Air Frying?  Absolutely.  It's great for a single person to eat healthy and cheap.  I throw a frozen pork chop or chicken breast in the fryer, sprinkle a little seasoning salt on top, set it for 20 minutes, go about my business, and dinner is ready.  No microwave, no drivethrough, and relatively cheap.  My friends laugh because none of them have ever heard of Air Fryers, and I talk about mine all the time.<br><br>All in all, would I buy this one again.  Yes I would.  But it would be more convenient with a flat bottom."
"Too small too use in dialy life"
"At last, a great way to cut calories but not compromise on food taste and texture."
"So Love Love Love It!!!! Use it all the time!!! But Cleaning it is a pain though..."
"Fabulous product.  I have never used any product more than I'm using this one.  My favorite food in the world is french fries (and I have the weight problem to prove it), but this Air Fryer makes some of the best fries I've ever had with virtually no oil and with a great crunch and flavor.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  It should be made \"Product of the Year\".<br>I can't wait to try all the other Recipes and to create some of my own too."
"Replaced out Fry Daddy with this. So far, it cooks everything pretty much the same. Amazing really."
"Best air fryer grease less.<br>Easy Cleaning and smoke and oil very light<br>But u need to put a few drop of oil rub a thin drop.  The chicken wings already have skin oil and pork chop put very little drops<br><br>10x less oil then pan fry and faster then baking<br>Very juicy and crisply"
"Excelente , I really recomend to anyone that is looking for Health with excelente taste.<br>Much better than fried with oil."
"How did I live without this? This Air Fryer makes cooking quick and easy and the food tastes amazing! I have tried the following<br>Grill cheese sandwich - 5 minutes and it's to die for.<br>Frozen fish stick - nice and crisy!<br>I even tried it on egg tart and came out delicious!<br>You basically need to reduce the temperate by 70F (compared to conventional oven) and reduce the time by half when using it. The reducing time by half is awesome when you are a busy mom who needs to feed hungry kids.<br>Bottomline, it's quick, easy and healthy! What more do you ask?"
"This is an awesome machine!  Our sweet potato fries came out crispy & delicious!!  It was so good my friend had me get one for her!!<br>Now we can have our favorite \"fried\" foods without the guilt and still love it!!!"
"fast shipment!! great product as advertised!!"
"Healthiest option ever had,fast and easy to cook & clean"
"VERY GOOD"
"Excellent product when used with a instant read thermometer.  I can cook about anything in it once I figure out<br>the time and temperature.  From frozen to fresh it works.  Just wish it was a bit bigger."
"Biggest negative, it doesn't clean well at all.  I ended up having to use a Brillo Pad.  The fat didn't come off even in a dishwasher.  The basket had pieces of food in it, and they wouldn't come out.  I tried banging the thing and putting it in a dishwash under \"Power Scrub\", still nothing.  I don't know how sanitary it is if you just use a dishwasher or clean by hand.  I will continue to clean with a Billo Pad.  The product is just OK."
"I had never heard of Air-Frying until a recent trip to Holland where they use this type of cooker like we use our microwaves.  Awsum for any type of fish.  Boneless chicken seems to cook better than bone in.  Beef isn't as good as the fish.  French fries are better than any you'll eat from an oil cooker.  We're having fun with the Air Fryer."
"This met my expectations. Fries are not as tasty as a deep frier, but seem healthier. And way easier to clean."
"Excellent product"
"Usually"
"I use it everyday for just about everything best thing I ever bought!! Gave one to my daughter and my best friend"
"Despite the difficulty of Cleaning the rack, (soaked for a long time and using brush) I think it is a really good AirFryer. I like it."
"Amazing!"
"awesome"
"I'm using that model for 4 years already, it's my 2nd one as I've moved from Europe to the States.<br>It's way faster than the T-Fal one.<br>It works great and the taste is similar to an oil fryer.<br>It's even better when you are using frozen fries and potatoes.<br>It works also great for Lumpia, spring rolls etc ... as well as chicken wings etc ..<br><br>I have bought several for my family and friends they all loved it !"
"Best Kitchen appliance I have ever had!"
"Good product but price dropped recently"
"free good"
"Just love my new airfryer!!"
"Excellent"
"Best healthy fries ever!"
"Everything is great. But there wasn't a food separator with it. I don't know if it don't come with it, or ther missed putting it in the box?????"
"Excelent"
"I've had my AirFryer for a few weeks now and I *love* it.  Butternut squash fries?  Easy.  Faux fried chicken fingers?  A breeze.  Even fancy stuffed meat rolls?  No problem.  I haven't ventured out into anything too wild, but all the standards \"fry\" up perfectly."
"I have NEVER had chicken breast cooked better, all I used was lemon pepper for seasoning and cooked about 10 minutes per side and it was perfect (I am NOT a cook in any way shape or form!)<br>French Fries......Don't get me going.......absolutely excellent, I make my own from fresh Idaho cut into 3/8\" pieces, rinse well and DRY!!! I spray a little peanut oil on them but I don't think it needed  cook about 10 minutes, shake the pan well and continue cooking another 10-15 minutes  EXCELLENT  none better<br>I am gonna do a steak tomorrow, can't wait!<br>Why am I here  because I am buying another  I love the chicken/steak AND the fries so I need 2 of them"
"This the second that I have purchased. It is awesome....."
"It is a Christmas gift."
"A friend of mine has one of these, I liked it so I bought one.  So far, it's great.  BUT, the temperature dial is calibrated in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit.  I zoomed in on the Amazon picture, and I see the one in the pic on this site is also in Celsius (temp. Dial starts at 80).  My friend's fryer is calibrated in F as it should be.  This seems to be a mistake in that these were likely intended for shipping to another country??  Frustrating...."
"Works great,  fast cooking ,  Bif applience, but the coocking basket is a little  small"
"It is the best thing<br>I have gotten for sin ce I am alone<br>And a diAbetic"
"After doing a lot of research on air fryers, I chose the Philips based on all the positive reviews.  I did find it hard to believe that it could actually cook more quickly and efficiently than my convection oven.  The first day I tried roasting some broccoli in it.  This would normally take 20 to 30 minutes in my steamer, or a good 30+ minutes in the convection oven.  I was totally skeptical when I pulled out the broccoli and it was perfectly roasted in about 12 minutes.  I figured it could NOT possibly be cooked through and would be raw in the middle, but I was wrong!  It was cooked perfectly all the way through and had a perfect crispy golden crust on it.  Even my husband liked it and he usually hates my roasted broccoli, because i have to practically burn the outside before the middle gets cooked in my convection oven.  The next thing I tried was roasted green beans, and ham and cheese melts.  Again, everything was perfectly done and took only minutes!  I only cook for my husband and I, but cooking usually takes so much time that I end up cooking a lot of casseroles, etc. on the weekend so we will have leftovers during the week.  But with the air fryer, its so easy to whip up a meal within a few minutes that I don't mind cooking smaller amounts for each meal.  Tonight I made stuffed peppers, first I cooked the meatballs -- they were perfectly done, crispy on outside and cooked through within about 12-15 minutes, so I stuffed them in the peppers with a little cheese and roasted them a few more minutes.  The peppers were cooked perfectly, not too crispy and not too mushy, and they were delicious.  The air fryer reminds of a microwave in how quickly it cooks, but it also crisps & roasts everything perfectly, too!  Its totally amazing and I'm really glad I got it!!  I thought about getting the new larger version, but when I measured it I quickly realized it would be much too large for our tiny kitchen, and this one fits perfectly.  A larger family might want to consider the Avance XL version, though."
"I recently purchased a real deep fryer because I am gluten free and wanted fried zucchini (zucchini was growing like crazy in my garden) which I had not had in 2 years. We made it and it tasted yummy but we got sooo sock from to much oil. So I ordered this air fryer and I am so pleased. So far we have made the bacon wrapped shrimp and the chicken tenders. Both Recipes came with the Fryer. Not to oily. Didn't even add oil to the bacon wrapped shrimp. Only 2 tablespoons for a whole pound of breaded chicken. The chicken tenders were very juicy."
"very good. The only problem is the missing on/off button. Once you set the time, you have to let it run till the end. Another thing i realize , it will not beep if the time is less than 5 minutes. Other than that i am pretty satisfy. easy to use and clean."
"While it takes longer to cook with, which means you don't have to stand over it, this thing cooks very well. Most importantly for my family, it doesn't stink up the whole house."
"This WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVES THAT I HAD MADE IT KEEPS ALOT OF GREESE OFF OF FREENCH FRIES AND ONION RINGS AND SHAVE S A LOT ON THOSES OLD GRESSEY FATS"
"Didn't  think I would like it.look and read the reviews some was correct some was they need to retract,hands down great air fryer I'm in love,my fish tasted just like fried fish and fresh French fries was great,it was fine for up to three serving,Phillip did the thing with this"
"It is an item you can do without. The process is very work intensive."
"Works great but if you spray your food witlh pam it will brown a lot better"
"well pleased"
"This one is really convenient. The best use of it is to cook those pre-made \"oven foods\". It only takes 3 minutes to preheat, and the cooking time can be reduced by half compared to a conventional oven. So it makes cooking as simple as microwave, while keeps the better result of conventional oven.<br><br>The only problem, which is actually a trade-off of oil-free frying, is the cooked food getting cold much faster. Because in traditional frying, oil on the surface of the food can reduce heat dissipating. The air-fryer blowed all the oil out from the surface, making air-cooling much faster. If you can accept this, you can buy it."
"Not a lot of Recipes around that are readily available to put this thing to good use. Can't cook for more then 2 people at a time with this . Holds less then I thought it would ."
"This is a awesome product. Fries with very less or no oil. I am not a big fan of healthy food, but eating fries from AirFryer taste as great as regular fries. We tried chicken wings and they came out great too."
"Love this airfryer!! I throw all sorts of frozen goodies in here and they all come out so crispy and delicious in just a few minutes!  Quiet, easy to clean, and super convenient.  Machine itself is a beautiful shiny white that fits perfectly with my kitchen :)"
"very good"
"I bought this air fryer because my kids just love fries. So far I have cooked frozen fries, home cut fries, sweet potato fries, chicken tenders, dumplings etc.. I was pretty happy with the results except for the part when I have to clean the basket and all of the oil and food scraps gets in between the mesh and the basket wall. It is just impossible to clean it. Every time I clean the mesh/basket I was thinking why couldn't they just make the basket Design so the mesh comes apart from the basket? Whoever designed this thing didn't think about the washing & Cleaning side of the aspect. I was so frustrated with Cleaning the mesh/basket, I ended up forcefully separating the mesh from the basket myself. Even though I made some scratches on the basket while doing that, it is much easier to clean the darn thing now!<br><br>Philips, please change the basket Design!!!"
"This is NOT a fryer.<br>If you have a hot-air oven it will do the same job for you as this little machine does.<br>If you want fried food, unfortunately you still have to boil it in oil. It is the only way.<br>Sorry."
"I just purchased the Phillips air fryer and so far I have just cooked frozen fries.  I love them.  There is a different taste compared to oil frying or baking.  I will be trying chicken wings and fresh fish next.  That is the ultimate test of my true opinion.  But so far, so good."
"I am ammending my review because after buying the grill pan separately, for the heck of it, I defrosted a steak, rubbed oliver oil on it, salted, peper and strinkled garlic powder on and using the grill pan, I got a pretty exceptable result.  The steak needs more seasoning that I used, but the steak was tender, moist and quite edible.  I suspect pork will work the same.<br><br>Works well, but I don't like the food I cooked in the unit, using the grill basket it came with:<br><br>1.  I put in some crinkle frozen fries and while they got brown and cooked through, they were hard and had little flavor.<br><br>2.  I cooked 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the grill pan (which I had to order separately).  I sprinkled the breasts with a tablespoon of olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder and cooked them for the proper amount of time, shaking them and turning them halfway through.  The chicken breasts are not dry, but they have little-to-no-flavor.<br><br>I bought this expensive unit so I could fry meats without having to deep fry them.  In my limited experience, the unit is absoutely NOT worth the money.  It's well made and easy to use, but the results are worse than if I simply oven-fried the fries and chicken.<br><br>Most of the YouTube videos are made by people in Europe and Australia, where the unit has been available longer than in the US.  Many of the videos reviewing the unit use chicken that is heavily spiced in an Indian-styled style, something I am not likely to cook.<br><br>All in all, the product is well made and easy to use, but the results are simply not good enough to warrant the expensive or the counter space.  I thought this was a total loss and waste of money, but it DOES grill a steak nicely."
"The product is very good and cooks great.<br>2 stars are because parts and support for White color model is not available through phillips and their parts reseller https://www.buyphilipsparts.com. Have been chasing phillips and parts reseller since October  2014 without any luck so far, to buy damaged white basket."
"First of all, if you are looking for a air-deepfryer, there is no such thing. I personally did not try to fry some potatoes with it, but it certainly does not \"fry\" meats. It's more like fan power oven; think it as a convection oven in a fancy housing.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, this thing makes cooking VERY convinient, and meats get cooked very evenly, but it just isn't a \"fryer.\"<br><br>I wasn't planning to dip fry anyways, so it's no biggies for me. The hard part is Cleaning the basket. I use the fryer for almost every meal, and the oil stain at the back of the net is not the easiest thing to clean. Also, the net gets pretty tricky to clean when burnt meat skin stick there. Philips recommands to clean the net after every use, so it won't catch on fire. I clean the net every time for sanitary purposes anyways, but it takes some time to do so.<br><br>Bottomline:<br>Not a fryer, but it cooks great, awesome for meat lovers, but hard to clean up the net."
"This is a very good fryer my whole family like it next year my younger son will bring to Ottawa. I think it suit him best,save a lot of his time study. My son love to cook steak,chop and rib as and fries.But I still have not receive my divider for the fries as and nuggets. Can someone respond me."
"I bought this product because a friend had one and she was quite pleased with hers.  I've had mine about two weeks and have used it several times.  Will take time to figure times for cooking.  Guidelines are very helpful, but you need to watch what your a cooking the first few times to see how long it really takes to cook.  Great for cooking with less fats."
"Perfect!! Makes your frozen food like freshly cooked/fried!"
"I bought this to replace a Fry-daddy and it makes it so much better !  We can make fries with no oil, and the taste is just as good."
"This air cooker is second to none in its class.  I do not know how I ever lived without it.  Simply amazing!"
"I like a lot about the fryer.  It is, though, hard to clean the grill and it smokes up my kitchen enough to set off the smoke alarms."
"I love this thing!  One of my husband's favorite foods is halibut, fresh from Alaska, deep-fat fried.  He couldn't eat it often because it was so full of fat cooked that way.  My son suggested we buy one of these and what a difference it makes!  The taste is improved by double, the calories cut in half.  We have fed halibut cooked this way to many of our Alaskan friends and they have also purchased this fryer for themselves.  Everyone loves the taste of the food.  I use this fryer to cook anything and everything I can.  I have never been disappointed.  What a great idea this is, especially these days when calorie intake seems to be exploding everywhere.  Buy one for yourself... you won't be disappointed!"
"I was really unsure about this, but so far very happy!  As soon as I got it unpacked and wiped down, I couldn't resist the urge to make a small batch of frozen sweet potato fries.<br><br>Well, I burnt the first batch to a crisp.  Not sure if it was because I used a misto to spritz them with olive oil first, made too small of a batch, or if I put them in for too long.  Using the guidebook reference, I put about 16 fries in for 16 minutes and this was way too long.  Also, they were stuck to the bottom of the basket.  I was really sad.  But, I gave it another shot.  New batch, NO oil, 11 minutes and I shook the basket about every 3 minutes to make sure they wouldn't stick.  They came out AWESOME!!<br><br>Like others have said, they are not the same as truly fried, but I didn't even care!  This does give you a MUCH better texture than heating them on a cookie sheet in the oven.  You get that crispy outside, soft inside, and each and every fry had that slightly crunchy perfection.  I am trying to resist the urge to make another batch, and can't wait to try other foods.<br><br>You may need to do some trial and error like I did, but just get it.  You'll be happy!"
"Mine stopped working after only a couple uses while I was cooking dinner. Wasn't impressed with the Quality."
"I love the sleek look of the item.  Although I can see me using it a couple times a week...it is rather bulky.  Luckily the item is not heavy, so I store it in Laundry room when not being used.  I love that the electric cord can be retracted into the machine.  I ordered item on Sunday, got it on Monday."
"Small basket to place enough food in for a dinner<br>I think the price was lower on amazon however, to purchase again I would wait till prices drop"
"PROS;<br>-Small size<br>-Delicious chips<br>-Built-in timer<br><br>CONS:<br>-Small capacity<br>-Versatile? Nah<br>-Expensive<br><br>If you don't worry about fat and crap, and just want tasty chips, get this one for cheaper price: http://bit.ly/1Hz4OQY"
"We LOVE it!!!  Even Better than I expected!!!"
"I received this as a gift complete with all the extra attachments I've had it about 3 months. And maybe have used it twice. I did it once with company for coconut shrimp they came out very nice. The second time I tried to make fried ravioli and it really dried it out terriblyI guess if you eat a lot of fried foods it's a good investment.but it only makes small quantities"
"Love this machine, we are a family of 5 so we constantly use it !! It's great for frying just about anything!"
"I first brought the secura it work twice and stop working I lost money so I hope this make up for it I used it once so far working good."
"Better than I thought"
"I researched a lot about air fryers in general and don't regret my choice. I fries really quick, don't get too warm a the food taste great. I use more than I though I would, even to just warm up some foods."

"I'm so happy with my airfryer! It's perfect!"
"I use this all the time.  Great just for two people.  Its like having a Health deep fryer, with less mess."
"This should be called philips dryer if you don't put any oil. I purchased one from woot and find it really hard to clean. I won't buy it if you let me choose again."
"The AirFryer arrived very quickly and just as ordered.  My wife and kids love it.  Thank you."
