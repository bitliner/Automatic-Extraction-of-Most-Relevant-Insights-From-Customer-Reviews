An offer from Slimming World and the glowing recomendations decided I would try it. I have not used it a lot yet so these are first impressions. Its not good for frozen chips, they taste like oven chips, dry and boring. I tried homemade chips and they are fantastic, with a good potato they tast better than fried chips and without all the fat. I tried them with spring rolls frozen and unfrozen, they came out well, but you have to experiment with the timing a bit. I tried battered fish frozen, it was quite good but timing needs more experimenting. On the whole so far its an extremely good buy especially for us chip addicts who are a bit overweight. I personally didn&apos;t like frozen chips done in it, but home made are really nice.</span>\n</div> ", "helpfulness" : { "positiveVotes" : null, "total" : null }, "hash" : "fdc7d5b40ee12ac56eac86edd92ce208", "cons" : null, "channel" : "philips.co.uk", "authorName" : "Ifortheengine", "authorLocation" : "Snowdonia", "authorGender" : "", "authorAge" : "", "_id" : "5522c26e55d62de700611001" } }

Easy to clean as long after use. I like the bell and auto switch off on the timer but the ticking noise it makes is a bit too loud for me and could do with being a bit quieter. The Air blower (essential of course) could do with being a bit quieter as well, but I am used to this now. to turn off before timer is complete you need to turn the timer back against resistance , which intuitively doesn&apos;t seem right, and I would also prefer an auto switch off of the Air blower when the cooking drawer is removed. There may be a reaon why it doesn&apos;t (eg it allows the element to overheat) though.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Resulting Cooked food is very good. I have only used it for Chips and a few other oven bake or fried food. You can cook battered fish in it at the same time as the chips using the divider of the basket. Ideal for One!! The fryer came with a booklet for basic and more adventurous cooking, which I might get round to use eventually. Early results in cooking were a bit patchy, and inconsistent, but with a bit of tweaking to the suggested cooking methods I now have 100% success with it.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">I bought it to have healthier chips etc with less fat and not to use lites of oil which then have to be discarded periodically. Both these objectives are fulfilled with the Air Fryer.</span>\n</div><div class=\"BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextLastParagraph\"> <span class=\"BVRRReviewText\">Overall I am pleased with the product Design, construction, with ease of use and cooking quality.

I tried a small basic pizza yesterday, adding extra tomato slices grated cheese and chorizo, it cooked beautifully, top nice and melted and base just right. I have cooked pre- baked sausage rolls, which come up brown, hot and crispy, chops, chicken breasts and fish are quick and easy. I haven&apos;t tried baking in it yet but intend to try soon. The baking tin is much too expensive - a third of the cost of the fryer. I measured the Basket size and bought one from another shop for &#xFFFD;4. It hasn&apos;t got a handle but apart from that does the job perfectly. If you want to see demos of food being cooked in the Airfryer go to YouTube, there are lots of ideas.

The advertisement leads you to believe NO oil is necessary to &quot;fry&quot;, that also is not true, however, the amount of oil you use is minimal. For the steep price I expected more detailed user information. I found out foods tend to stick to the basket so I now use a product like Pam to keep this to a minimum. The things that cook best in this fryer are things meant to be cooked in an oven (i.e., prepackaged). Using fresh produce, meat, etc. things turn out but only after a lot of work and trying to figure out the correct time/temperature. I would recommend it on the merit that it does reduce the amount of oil in fried foods and as I use it more and more I will, most likely, learn to like it more. Right now I give it a 6 out of 10.</span>\n</div> ", "helpfulness" : { "positiveVotes" : 8, "total" : 8 }, "hash" : "da956b516496e853db87af66859eadef", "cons" : "poor instructions with product, fresh items stick to basket, timer must run out you can't canel it, the high price", "channel" : "usa.philips.com", "authorName" : "Georgiagirl", "authorLocation" : "Atlanta, GA", "authorGender" : "Female", "authorAge" : "Over 50", "_id" : "5522c55455d62de7006111f2" } }

Perhaps my expectations were too high.<br><br>Firstly, the product is poorly designed. It comes in a huge box which is heavy (as the product description states). The product itself is ungainly. It took two of us to get it out of the box! The packaging is designed in a way that means you can't remove it until it is out of the box. It would be much easier to unpack if you could lift off the top half of the packaging and remove the cooker.<br><br>The Airfryer is very big and has no handles, simply indents at the base of the unit, making it easy to tip over when you lift it up or and difficult to move it around. It is not suitable for a compact London kitchen. The mechanism that separates the frying basket from the oil tray is at the top of the handle, exactly where you naturally put your thumb. My partner barely escaped being scalded by hot oil when removing the cooking compartment to get his chips out (like most men, he didn't read the instruction manual).<br><br>Critically, I found the fryer was very disappointing in it's performance. The chips we got out of it were neither crisp nor golden, just brown in patches and almost raw in others. We followed the instructions exactly and the results were nothing like the photos shown.

I bought it shortly after it's launch (then 200 pounds on Amazon .... now about 25 pounds less) and tried it on home made chips - not great ... but, hey ... why should I care? As up to now I've always used frozen chips in a deep fryer. The deep fryer gave fab results - but also an unhealthy amount of fat.<br>So the AirFryer is a much healthier option and takes an acceptable 15 mins (a little longer than the instructions suggest) for delicious results.<br><br>However I don't find it as versatile as a deep fryer as it does not cook some of the foods you could deep fry - but it also means you eat a healthier diet.<br><br>Large and Heavy - yes, as some reviews say the machine is quite large (the actual counter top 'foot-print' is about the same as a deep fryer but it is twice as tall). However height is not a problem in my kitchen. Yes it is fairly heavy - but as there is no oil inside you don't need to worry about tipping it as you move it to store it. And not as heavy as an old-fashioned cake Mixer & bowl device.<br><br>So - on balance a good addition if you like to have chips or similar from time to time and want to a healthier diet AND great if you HATE cleaning deep fat fryers (all that encrusted brown 'fat' that adhered to the lid and bowl etc.)", "language" : "gb", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T16:08:29.995Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=byRankDescending", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-20-Airfryer-Healthier/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top/276-9638689-5637336", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R875937U78GE8/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EU3A2", "pubDate" : "2010-12-19T00:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "best" : 5, "value" : 4 }, "source" : "amazon.co.uk", "subtitle" : "Great for frozen chips but ...", "title" : "Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black (Kitchen & Home)", "votes" : { "total" : 71, "positiveVotes" : 64 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

Following the instructions I got pretty much the same results each time, some cooked all the way through, some not. It doesn't really crisp up the chip, no more than an oven would do anyway. I also did some fish fingers, but then any kind of heat could cook them. I then tried to cook some chicken legs. Frequent turning is necessary as the chicken skin went black quite quickly. The results were cooked through but needed longer than the book specified to achieve this. Again, why do I need an AirFryer when I could have easily done the exact same thing in my oven.<br><br>I suppose the big question is, after it being pretty redundant as a fryer, how is this better than a conventional oven? Well its not. It's difficult to regulate as the included cook book is very hit and miss as to the results. You would have to play around with settings and timings to get the desired results. Obviously conventional cookbooks direct you for use with an oven, so you'd have to interpret the recipe for the AirFryer.<br><br>I suppose the market for this appliance is families with young kids, and as kids can't seem to get enough chicken nuggets and chips, this offers a healthy way to make them... not sure I quite understand the logic behind that. If you're that conscious of your kids diet then wouldn't you try to offer healthy alternatives rather than giving them slightly less unhealthy food? I just don't see how this device can be at all useful, even to those outside the target market. Even using the AirFryer to bake with (some Recipes like brownies etc are included though I didn't try them) the tray is too small to make anything more than three or four cakes or muffins at a time.<br><br>The AirFryer tries to be something, but hasn't quite worked out what. It's not a fryer, it's not as versatile, as large or as good as a conventional oven. It doesn't produce good results even following the book and to top it all your kitchen will be steamed out by the time your cooking is done (I had to have a window open when using it).<br><br>Sad to say that at over one hundred pounds this is not worth it. You either buy a deep fat fryer, stick with your oven or just have fried food on the occasion if your Health conscious.

This product is most closely comparable to the Actifry, measuring up well in some ways but falling short in others.<br><br>The Airfryer is a counter top fan oven. The food is cooked in a basket that is pulled out from the bottom half of the Airfryer and can be removed from the main housing for easy Cleaning (a quick soak and rub with a washing up brush is all that mine has needed).<br><br>The power cord can be pushed back into the base so that part of the storage is simple however it is also a rather large item (quite high at around 32 cm and with only a slightly smaller diameter of circa 28 cm), defying any attempts to fit in my crowded kitchen cupboards and therefore occupying valuable workspace.<br><br>A fairly inspiring recipe book is included, demonstrating that even things like cakes can be cooked in this item - but the reason for this is actually one of the failings of the product; unlike the Actifry, cooking food merely has hot air blown over it - there is no stirring mechanism incorporated. Where necessary, food needs to be manually stirred during the cooking process and this can be tricky if the basket has been filled to the maximum level and you are cooking chips, for example, for four people. Having said that, I found that oven chips came out better than they do if cooked in my fan oven (even though this is done on a specially designed tray) and small portions can (just about) come out well even if you forget to stir partway through (I have done so).<br><br>Continuing with oven chips as an example, the chunky ones that I have cooked in this invariably take around 25 minutes to cook well. This is no different to the time they take in my fan oven, so I don't find food is cooked any faster with the Airfryer.<br><br>It is a bulky item and the lack of an incorporated stirring mechanism, whilst allowing cakes to be cooked, means it can be tricky to get items to cook evenly. If you are cooking for one, this has utility as it may avoid the need to heat an entire oven but if the oven is on for other items anyway, I can't see this adds anything to the equation.

It is too tall for all my cupboards and as the power cord is so short I had to completely rearrange my kitchen in order to use it. It is incredibly heavy! 10kgs! My microwave weighs half this!<br><br>It is super noisy when Pre-heating - my house mate came investigating upon hearing the noise and eyeing the black box asked why I was using star wars props in the kitchen? I mean really! Yet the buzzer that sounds the end of cooking time is super quite, you can't have the TV going or be out of the kitchen as you will not hear it go off.<br><br>I found that the airfryer left chicken and vegetable quite dry. I even attempted to bake using the airfryer  but having to find a cake tin that fits is rather hard! And was very concerned over how high my bread might rise as the basket isn't very deep!<br><br>Now as I initially purchased this with the intention of cooking low fat chips having now tried in the airfryer I would rather use my conventional oven as the airfryer doesn't evenly spread heat. Not to mention the fact that the cooking times for chips varied across the box packaging, the recipe guide and the labels on the airfryer itself!<br><br>And as far as safety in the kitchen is concerned, when you pull out the basket to toss / check your food the heat still keeps pumping out! At least with my conventional oven I can shut the door! This is not a product to have in your house if you have children! Not to mention the fact that the baskets release catch is at the top of the handle and more than once whilst in the process of removing my food managed to hit the release accidently and the sold metal box dropped to the floor , the first time hitting my foot!

In an effort to try and become healthy whilst satisfying a frequent craving for chips, the Philips AirFryer seemed to be the perfect weapon of choice. Yes it was expensive and there were some negative reviews but on the whole the good far outweighed the bad so I decided to take the plunge and to be honest I don't look back.<br><br>Gone are the days where my gas oven used to be on for up to 40 minutes, warming up to the right temperature and then actually cooking .... Trying to achieve the perfect chip was always challenging with varying results and baking trays being ruined through pre covered oil found on most oven chips. Now life is simple, I turn on my AirFryer, set the timer and by the time I return from the freezer with my chips it's reached the target temperature (Less than 3 minutes to reach 200 degrees, far quicker than most ovens and other types of fryers to my knowledge). I open the sliding drawer, pop the chips in the basket then close it. (Note, for oven chips you don't have to even put any oil in the fryer). After about 7 minutes I simply pull out the drawer, shake it to break up the chips in the basket and then pop them back in. After anther 7 minutes the timer pings and my chips are ready to perfection. Ok I admit, it only pings once which is not ideal but everything shuts down once the timer has gone off so if you don't hear it, your food won't keep cooking and get ruined and if you know your cooking something that takes less then 15 minutes, even if you don't hear the ping your going to be watching the time anyhow and let's be honest old fashioned egg timers never made any sound but I still managed to get the results I needed. Note your cooking time will vary depending on the quantity of food in your basket but there is a guideline that comes with your AirFryer and as they say practice does make perfect.<br><br>I have also read that some people think that the AirFryer is noisy, well to be honest its not quiet, but it makes a lot less noise than my current fan oven and its also running for a fraction of the time so overall is a lot less annoying and probably saving money on my existing utility bills.  Other reviews also say its really big, again I would have to question this and say in comparison to what, a hand blender, Yes and cake mixer or slow cooker No. I have a small kitchen and it fits perfectly in the corner of the worktop and with its slick black finish sometimes it's hardly noticeable. Other things I also really like are the easy cord storage that feeds into the base and allows me to conceal any unnecessary cable plus the fact that if all the hard work of cooking exhausts me and I can't manage to wash up, the main drawer and basket of the fryer are both dishwasher proof. Life truly is tuff these days.<br><br>Overall this is a perfect gadget for impatient fast food lovers that are looking to satisfy their indulgences in a quicker time with healthier results. The AirFryer does also come with a recipe booklet containing great examples of other things you can cook apart from chips showing you its true versatility so I'll let you know how I get on....  In addition to this though if you are still not convinced Philips are offering a 60 day buy back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose.....", "language" : "gb", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T16:14:29.652Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_link_next_13/276-9638689-5637336?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=byRankDescending", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-20-Airfryer-Healthier/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top/276-9638689-5637336", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R2KV9M80TN9V1X/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EU3A2", "pubDate" : "2011-06-27T00:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "best" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.co.uk", "subtitle" : "A healthy chip that tastes as good as the bad ones....Brilliant!", "title" : "Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black (Kitchen & Home)", "votes" : { "total" : 7, "positiveVotes" : 6 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

Items such as oven chips cook really well but what's the point when you can put them in the oven.

The final point is that you definitely need to give the basket a number of shakes during the cooking process otherwise the food cooks unevenly.<br><br>Overall it's a reasonable product but to be honest I can't see us using it particularly often. I might experiment with different foods but nowadays most food that you might have cooked in a deep fat fryer years ago can be done in the oven as food manufacturers have moved away from deep fried food.

It's essentially a healthier substitute for a deep-fat fryer, which uses some sort of 'air-frying' technique to fry food using much less oil. The benefits of this are fairly obvious; it's healthier and much less wasteful of oil. On top of that, the chips it produces are very tasty, though no matter what I do I can't seem to replicate the Belgian/French style fries that the side of the box seems to promote. The type of potato you use can make a big difference to how chips come out, and you must prepare them properly in order to get them as crisp as possible. The product comes with a crudely assembled recipe booklet, which offers a few decent recipes as an introduction to using the AirFryer but nothing more than that. Combined with the brief set of instructions, you'll probably find that you do most of your learning by trial and error.<br>One of the downsides to this product is the size - it is MASSIVE. If you have a small kitchen then you may struggle to find somewhere to store it when you're not using it. It also only has a relatively small basket to cook food in, considering how big the actual cooker is.<br>Another downside is that you have to make sure your chips are completely dry before cooking them if you want them to end up crispy - though they never end up quite like proper deep-fried french fries.<br>If you like homemade chips but want a healthier alternative to a deep-fat fryer then this will do the job just fine.

I guess one of its main uses for a lot of people will be to make chips; I have already tried wedges, chips and potato cubes. The skin was left on the wedges and I felt they didn't 'crisp up'. But the chips and cubes are very very good - lovely crispy edges with nicely cooked centres (I'm sure the wedges would be great too with a bit of tweaking). The fryer is very quick too, being up to temperature in about 2 minutes and being relatively quick to cook. All that is needed is to coat chips with minimal oil and give a quick shake after 5 minutes or so.<br>I have used it for other things too - fish fingers, onion bhajis, filled potato skins and fishcakes. All were crispy on the outside and hot through. This highlights one of the main benefits of this fryer. It is more like a mini oven, with an element like an electric cooker ring and a fan to disperse the heat evenly. This means that it is much quicker to do these sorts of foods than wait on your oven to preheat and then heat your food. I have prepared all these foods so far without looking at the instructions and Recipes provided, so I'm keen to look at those to find out the full extent of its capabilities.<br>I have never owned a deep fat fryer due to the fat content, but I do like fried food!

The whole point of the airfryer is that is that it uses a fraction of the oil that deep frying requires and is, therefore, a whole lot healthier.<br><br>I have had my airfryer for three months now and found it to be an invaluable piece of kitchen equipment, not like a lot of other gadgets I have bought over the years.<br><br>I experimented with chips and found a method that is foolproof and produces delicious chips which are enjoyed by my grandchildren and whole family.<br><br>You can prepare the chips in advance and soak them in cold water which helps to remove the starch.  When you are ready to make the chips change the water in the pan you have been soaking the chips in, bring them to a boil and simmer for 2 - 3 minutes so that the outside is very slightly cooked, drain thoroughly until dry and shake the pan vigourously to roughen the outside of the chips ever so slightly. Add the suggested amount of oil and sprinkle lightly with semolina whilst shaking to coat well.  You can also experiment with adding paprika, salt or dried garlic at this point.<br><br>Whilst frying the chips shake the pan halfway through the cooking time.  I initially put them in on 200 for 10 minutes.  Depending on what sort of potatoes you use you might need another 5 minutes.  I defy anyone to say these chips are not delicious. My grandchildren adore them and I feel I am giving them a healthy food which I wouldn't if they were deep fried.<br><br>I have used the airfryer for other things and they have all turned out well. Roast potatoes in goose fat are gorgous and you only need a little bit of the melted fat to coat them.  I do think you have to experiment and not give up after the first try.  I have just ordered the pan which fits inside so am looking forward to trying lots of other foods in the near future.  There is a cookery book which comes with the airfryer but there are not many recipes in it.  I hope one soon becomes available, if not I will have to write one!!!!<br><br>I would say to anyone who can afford them ~ and they are available much more cheaply now ~ to go ahead and buy one if you have the room on your worktop to accommodate it as it takes a bit of room, much like a food processor.

After having been chopped into shape your chips will need to be patted dry with a paper towel or similar and then oiled prior to cooking.  The manual also recommends soaking the chips for 30 minutes prior to drying and oiling them but I have found this to make little difference and no longer bother with this stage.  On the plus side the resulting chips are crisper than those I cooked using a deep fat fryer and are presumably healthier too.

But even so, I must admit that I am still struggling a bit to see what it does that our fan oven can't. The airfryer only circulates hot air, which is what a fan oven does. I agree that it can make lovely home made chips which are crunchy on the outside and soft inside, but it's an expensive chip maker unless you eat chips several times a day.<br>So far my wife has used it mainly to cook meals for the kids and it is pretty convenient and fast to cook for two small kids who occaisionally want chicken nuggets and chips for lunch. But what it does that our fan oven won't is a little bit of a mystery to me, apart from the Speed of cooking with it. I was hoping to throw away our deep fat fryer after buying this, as part of a general diet cleanup for the family, but I still see a need for the fryer for certain things, even though it is used very rarely. For instance I can't see how you could put a piece of battered fish in this without the batter dripping out of the pan, which the bottom of has holes like a sieve. But we've cooked chicken pieces in it that came out very nice and moist, although not so brown. OK, maybe we did it incorrectly and there is a way of browning without overcooking, but we're still quite new at this. I also once cooked chips and fish nuggets for four people and almost filled the basket, but the bits in the middle were not cooked so well and needed further cooking. So it's not a great idea to fill up the basket.<br><br>Would I have bought it knowing what I know now ? I guess so, only my expectations wouldn't have been as high as they were, and I would maybe not have been in such a hurry to buy one as I was. As far as health benefits go, I do see how it's better for the kids if my wife sticks sausages/nuggets/chips in the airfryer rather than using a frying pan with lots of oil, although those kinds of things can also go in the oven. But I noticed that she used to use the frying pan a lot for speed and convenience to quickly cook a small bite to eat for the kids, which is where the airfryer wins big over an oven or frying pan, i.e. quick (no need to wait for oven to pre-heat) and also cooks faster than a fan oven at the same temperature, far less oil if any at all, and a far healthier way of cooking than the frying pan.<br><br>Will your life or kitchen be incomplete without one ? No. Is it convenient ? Very much so, especially if you have one or two kids. Just please be aware of what this actually is/does before you buy. For us the main driver for using it is an almost healthy version (or certainly not bad) of traditionally fried food for the kids, all usually done in 10-15 minutes and no oven trays to clean.

It cooks quickly and very evenly, so long as you shake the basket (as per manufacturer instructions)- only a brief shake a couple of times - no pancake style flipping is necessary! I have not found it difficult to relocate the basket either into its holder or into the body of the machine, it's just a knack to learn. The price is VERY variable, so it's well worth spending time checking various outlets/sites; I saved nearly 40%. I would definitely advise buying the version that comes with the baking accessory as I'm having difficulty sourcing it separately from Philips (the website constantly says 'out of stock' though they have reduced its price for the January sales - you just can't actually buy it!)<br>I have no hesitation in recommending the airfryer, both for baking from fresh or frozen, the food retains its moisture and doesn't go hard compared to oven baking and it genuinely scarcely needs oil to give the fried effect. My family are fussy eaters, but are completely in agreement about the excellence of this gadget. As it is not too large (easily fitting under my upper kitchen units) I'm actually considering buying a SECOND one (with the baking accessory included!) as it is only large enough to cook four portions of anything at once. The divider works well for cooking protein one side and veg the other, but really only enough to feed two people (unless you are much stronger willed than we are at resisting delicious food.) I've found it particularly useful for producing puddings without having to be nipping in and out of the kitchen during a meal, as it cooks so quickly that starting it at the same time as clearing main course plates has allowed me to spend more time enjoying the meal, too.<br>Be aware, the black version is a large chunk of solid black and does look rather like Darth Vader's helmet - and indeed makes a not dissimilar noise - so if you have a very light and bright kitchen, you may well prefer the white version.

Some people had said it does not cook the food even etc.<br>After a few weeks contemplating this purchase, I decided to buy one knowing that I can return it to Phillips within 60 days for a full refund.<br>I need not of worried............ its pure brilliance !<br>I started with some oven chips, just to see how they come out and I was quite happy with the results, however, the main reason I got this was to be able to have my own homemade chips without the oil. I stuck to the instructions, did a max weight of 800g (I found this could easily feed 3 adults) I soaked them in water for 30 mins, dried them with kitchen roll, added a small amount of olive oil and popped them in the airfryer.<br>The results far exceeded my expectations ! I thought they came out great and tasted very nice !<br>Over the last 6 weeks I have started to experiment with the fryer, I have found it does not really make a difference if you soak the chips or not, as long as you dry them, they seem to come out the same. I have also come to the conclusion that the chips need to be shaken frequently during cooking, I tend to give them a quick shake every 10 mins, just to make sure all the chips get an even cook and also stops them from sticking together during cooking.<br>I have also tried vegetables; Mushrooms, Carrots, Courgette, Parsnip, Turnip and so on, again all have come out far better than I thought they would !<br>Im now totally hooked on the airfryer and its turned into one of the most used appliances in my kitchen, even my husband is pleased with the results.<br>Overall best purchase I ever made, totally worth every penny !", "language" : "gb", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T16:08:29.994Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=byRankDescending", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-20-Airfryer-Healthier/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top/276-9638689-5637336", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1CDW25LXEZTN6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EU3A2", "pubDate" : "2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "best" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.co.uk", "subtitle" : "The best kitchen item I have ever purchased !", "title" : "Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black (Kitchen & Home)", "votes" : { "total" : 97, "positiveVotes" : 87 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

I've found I cook everything in it - it's really good to roll up bacon and stand it on it side and it cooks really quickly and crispy in a couple of minutes for bacon sandwiches - we put microwave meals in it, like macaroni cheese and it comes out with a lovely crispy top and cooked all the way through - wrap chicken breast in palma ham with a sprig of herbs, home made pain au chocolate - all crispy on the outside and soft melted chocolate in the middle.  The only issue with it are getting the basket in and out - you need to watch out as the release button pulls the basket up and drops the base (which will crack and I've had to replace it once) - so make sure the base is standing on something when you do this and it does take up a lot of room in the dishwasher.  On the other hand it's there, ready to use, heats up in minutes, cooks everything crispy and fast and the timer which switches it off makes it easy for the kids to use.

Only two controls, one of temperature and the other the timer. My reason for getting it was chips. Normal fryers have the problems of oil, with all the problems that comes with it. By using the Philips Airfryer you have no oil to dispose of and a greatly reduced fire risk. I imagine that it could be possible to ignite it but it would take a lot of effort, as it only has a thirty minute timer. So you can have much healthier chips and without the smell.<br><br>The fryer comes with a quick start guide; 30 quick recipes in a trilingual (English French and Dutch) format; and a Getting Started card with settings for various chip sizes. So you should be able to have some chips cooked in no time. The only thing that you need to do is make sure that you have enough chips to cook. When set up the Airfryer is quite tall 33cm and probably too tall to put in a cupboard.<br><br>As to using it. It is very simple to use. Once you put the food into the tray and set the temperature just turn it on by setting the timer to the time required. When running it makes a bit of noise but tolerable. Once the timer has run its course there is a bell to tell you that it is finished. You can then pour out your chips. It is not just a simple fryer. So if you can think outside the box it can be used like a mini oven or grill.  One of the first things that I tried cooking was a cauliflower cheese. I found a pyrex bowl that was small enough to fit into the fryer tray and then prepared the cauliflower and as it was already cooked the addition of cheese and sauce finished it off. Twenty minutes in the fryer was all that it needed. Lovely crisp cheese topping made it perfect. There is even a recipe for ring doughnuts, which I must try one day.<br><br>If you love oven chips or onion rings then this is perfect. It means you can produce chips so quickly, in twenty minutes or less and it probably is cheaper to run than a full sized oven, as the hot air circulates within the oven and with the odd shake allows you to cook them evenly and with less hot air lost when you open it to check.", "language" : "gb", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T16:09:01.214Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_link_next_2/276-9638689-5637336?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=byRankDescending", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-20-Airfryer-Healthier/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top/276-9638689-5637336", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3342FYVDI3EXD/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EU3A2", "pubDate" : "2012-09-15T00:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "best" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.co.uk", "subtitle" : "expensive but well worth considering.", "title" : "Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black (Kitchen & Home)", "votes" : { "total" : 4, "positiveVotes" : 4 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

Now, regularly I cook fries (frozen and fresh), jack potatoes, wedges, grilled veggies and sometimes, I heat other fried items which are left overs and had to be kept in oven to come back to original crisp ones... This fryer is like a life saving appliance and I have several reasons to tell this... I don't put oil for cooking of foods, means I eat low cholesterol food with minimum or no oil. This leads to healthy and fat free diet... And most importantly, it takes less place to operate and Cleaning is very easy and kind of compact and not at all noisy... I love this appliance...

I reasoned that the healthier diet options from low fat cooking would do my aging body more good than tramping around the fields in the cold and wet twice a day. About a year ago, seduced by the TV advert, my wife bought a Tefal Actifry which worked for all of 3 weeks. When I read the reviews and discovered numerous others had had equal unreliability issues, good old Amazon gave me a full refund. Not wanting to suffer the same experience with another new \"low fat\" gizmo, I spent time thoroughly researching performance from users and professional reviewers. As you will see from the many reviewers here already, its a great product that does what it claims. There's little to go wrong because its basically just a nicely styled fan oven that sits on a worktop and looks like a bread maker.  The  chips and cubes are really crispy and brown by just following the simple instructions. It's so easy to use and the two part pan/sieve is dishwasher friendly.

Enter the Air Fryer - Wow - the first chips we did were the very same oven \"less than 5% fat\" chips. Not only did they cook faster - 15 minutes (from cold) rather than 20/ 22 minutes in my fan assisted oven I was also not heating up an entire family sized oven for a tray of chips. Shaking every 5  minutes wasn't a problem. The smell was of \"proper\" chips but not as overpowering as deep frying and the chips were gorgeous. It is true they are not the same as those from a shop but they are significantly better than done in the traditional oven. Since then we have done scampi and are itching to try wedges - sweet potato or ordinary. The scampi I did together with the chips - put the chips in first then added the scampi to the same basket. Very handy. We are a family of 3 and it will hold enough for a lunch of chips and something but over that I can see a need to do in two batches. What I am looking forward to is a few chips with a salad in summer or the garlic prawns.<br>The book that comes with it is good but I did also buy the two books that will appear in your recommendations. They are ok - the main value is ideas for other items. For example I can't wait to do bacon - will save a huge grill pan wash! cleaning is very easy. The pan comes fully out and the basket comes out of that. Both are diswasher safe which I have done. However as breaded food can stick to the basket I now hand wash - but it is non-stick so no metal utensils or scourer.", "language" : "gb", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T16:50:29.971Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_link_next_85/276-9638689-5637336?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=byRankDescending", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-20-Airfryer-Healthier/dp/B0042EU3A2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top/276-9638689-5637336", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R21XZSHNEUCD2Y/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EU3A2", "pubDate" : "2013-02-22T00:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "best" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.co.uk", "subtitle" : "AMAZING Product", "title" : "Philips HD9220/20 Airfryer Healthier Oil Free Fryer, Black (Kitchen & Home)", "votes" : { "total" : 2, "positiveVotes" : 1 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

I set the temperature at 200° & the timer for 20 minutes,  then it was a case of just leaving it to cook. Half way through I removed the basket to give everything a shake as recommended - make sure it's on a heat proof surface as it continues to run when the basket is removed.<br>The results were pretty amazing - they are the best oven chips I've ever had; not over dry,  but lovely & crisp all the way round. The chicken nuggets were beautifully cooked & crispy too.<br>My only warning is that reading the FAQs suggests that the fryer comes with a divider for the basket,  to separate foods being cooked together. This model does not have the divider or the baking tray - there is another model which has these features.<br>Anyway,  I bought it primarily for cooking chips & it has certainly fulfilled that requirement.

Apparently Philips say from 2011 they only supply this plate to Australia and Korea ? The other box must have been there awhile.<br>They refunded me the £11 it would cost to buy one from Philips.<br>There are Youtube videos on using this item, the ones I saw were done by an Australian presenter and she was using the separator plate and bowl, which for some reason I can't fathom, Philips are happy to supply them with but not Europe.<br>I can imagine the meeting at Philips, Top executives sitting around a big table pontificating about the Europeans not being trusted with this tiny separator plate.

Only thing I would say,start the jackets off in the microwave for a few minutes then transfer to the Air fryer, we found they took an awfully long time to cook solely in the Airfryer. Pasties and Battered Onions heat up and are lovely and crispy. So keeps our cholesterol down. In fact hubby's cholesterol was down to 4.2 recently. Obviously I cannot say it was down to the Airfryer but it certainly helps. We don't find it noisy like others have commented. We do shake the chips frequently to make them cook evenly but not a problem. For a healthier way of eating chips  you cannot better it. The airfryer looks good too and we haven't noticed finger marks as I thought we might being shiny black.

Quite honestly, I have found that for the best chips, use frying chips, in the oven with a drizzle of sunflower/olive oil to coat them, then give them 20-25 minutes at 200 degrees c, they come out far better than any oven chip and certainly a lot better than this.<br>It is huge as well, if you have a small kitchen you will struggle to find a home for it!  Also, it gives off a lot of steam when in use, so don't do as I did and stand it under the wall cupboards, with lights above, they started to flicker as they were shorting out from the moisture!!<br>So over all, in my opinion, a good product if you want low fat but tasteless chips, it is well made and does do what it says it will, but as with anything, you have to remember that if you remove the fat, you remove the flavour.

They do taste a little different compared to 'proper' chips, but the only way to describe that difference is 'less oily'. Of course, oily chips are delicious but rather unhealthy so this small sacrifice is worth it. They still taste great, which is important to note, just not quite the same.<br><br>I'm currently experimenting with seasonings and different potatoes to try and achieve perfection, but I was happy with the results from the off.<br><br>One of the main benefits is how easy it is to clean. I don't have a dishwasher, so I wash the basket and drawer in the sink like I would was a frying pan. The only difference is it's quicker and easier than washing a frying pan.<br><br>There was one accessory I thought would be included but wasn't; a drawer divider for cooking two things at once. It wasn't mentioned in the advert but I had read about it in one of the online reviews. As it turns out, this is only included in Australia and South Korea but I contacted Philips customer care and they were kind enough to send me one free of charge. They were very helpful and I have only good things to say about their post-sales service.<br><br>The only criticism I can come up with is the basket size itself. If I am making chips (for 2 adults and 1 child) I fill the basket, meaning I still need to use the oven for the rest of the meal. I'm not sure how some people claim to have stopped using their oven completely, but this is a limiting factor for me. Of course, there is a larger (and obviously, more expensive) version so I feel it would be unfair to mark it down on this basis.<br><br>I have tried cooking a couple of other things in this, but I have to agree with the majority in that this will more than likely be used solely for chips in your house and mine (partially due to the limited basket size mentioned above). From that point of view it is a bit of a one-trick-pony, albeit a premium one. However, this was the primary reason for my purchase and in that regard it does a magnificent job.<br><br>** UPDATE **<br><br>Having tried a few different methods, I can now make chips that are BETTER tasting than those delicious deep fried chips.

Had a few teething problems to begin with, not using enough oil (anyone who can get away with 1 spoonful obviously has no taste buds) chips not cooking in middle and hard and inedible, potato stuck to bottom of basket like cement!!  However after reading other peoples reviews I have it sussed now I parboil the potatoes, then put some oil in a tray and shake the chips in it till coated and I put a small piece of tinfoil in bottom of basket until chips begin to cook then it can be removed, the result is the most wonderful home cooked chips and wedges (skin on) and oven chips are amazing (especially Asda Leith school of food type).  The fryer is used at least once a week and we have not been near a chip shop since!!

Used it for the first time this evening, made marinated chicken drumsticks and French fries. I must say that I was sceptical about the Quality of the food cooked in this way. No more. I first did the chicken for 20 minutes (15 would've been fine too). Perfect is a big word, so I leave it in amazing. Crispy skin and juicy; thoroughly cooked inside. Zero greasiness. The chips in 15 minutes were simply perfect. Better than fried with oil, %100. Crunchy, golden outside and soft and fluffy inside. The only downside is the size of the basket. Is early days yet, but I almost wish I had bought a model with a bigger basket now. Compared to frying the same meal the traditional way, is like comparing the performance of a Ferrari against a push bike. It took less than 40 minutes to have perfectly cooked Chicken and Chips for two people. No smoke, oil-spitting, hardly any smell. Easy to wash and store away. It is also very safe and even kids could use it safely with a little supervision. I think this model is great for people living alone and couples, mostly because of size of basket.

I bought the Airfryer about 2 weeks and ago and in that time have cooked Home made bread, Muffins, Chips, Bacon, Hashbrowns, Sausages and everything has come out lovely! i'm really impressed how versitile this product is as traditionally people view these as 'Just for chips'.<br><br>The Actifry we owned for a year and a half was only ever used for chips, I always thought it produced good results but was let down in a few ways, the paddle would sometimes mash the potatos up, cause bits to fall off, chips to get stuck at the top so you'd have to knock them back into the dish and my biggest annoyance... when it was finished it would beep but not stop!<br><br>The Airfryer is the complete opposite, it produces lovely crisp chips with a soft fluffy inside, if I had to deduct a point it would be that you have to shake the chips half way through (Which for the sake of 10-15 seconds isnt the end of the world). Some people say you have to soak the chips for 30 minutes in water, I've only done this once out of... 3 occasions and the results were the same whether I soaked them or just rinsed them briefly. You also cannot just 'pour' the oil over them and let it mix around like in the actifry, I normally just chuck them in a dish and quickly put a bit of virgin olive oil over them and mix it around.<br><br>Home made bread - It took 20 minutes in the airfryer (at 160 degrees for those interested) and produced incredible results! Bacon and sausage cooked beautifully, the bacon went lovely and crispy and all the fat was collected in the bottom and well away from the food.

(We have not had a deep-fat fryer in the house for over 10 years, both for Health reasons and because they are so dirty and greasy).<br>I had bought frozen chips, both chunky and string type to be ready when it came. We had children visiting so the AirFryer was unpacked, rinsed out and plugged in within minutes of its arrival. It is so simple to use, just plug in, set the timer and walk away. It looks good too, with a shiny black easy-clean finish. The children were very impressed with their chips and at ages 11, 10 and 9 they are competent and honest critics. We went through both bags of frozen chips in the one sitting.<br>My husband normally would not think of eating chips but he loved them too.<br>It is a heavy object but I like that, it feels as if it is sturdy and has Quality and it will not get knocked over easily. You pull out the food drawer, pop in the food and close it. It says you should preheat but I don't, instead I add a minute to the cooking time as I feel the preheating is wasted when the food drawer is opened. It is not very loud - sounds like a low-powered hair dryer during cooking and a pleasant bell sounds when the food is ready.<br>Cooking times are approximate, but you MUST shake the food to turn and crisp it, we keep peeping in and tasting. I have added a couple of minutes to get the crispiness we like to the chunky chips.<br>We have it 3 weeks now and it is being used regularly. Aside from the chips and potatoes another thing we cooked in it was chicken legs. This was very brave I thought, as chicken is so dangerous if not fully cooked thru'. My son found chicken pieces in the fridge marinating in a thick sauce I'd made, and decided to have our dinner ready when we came in from work. I had intended to precook the chicken before Airfrying it, but he just lobbed it into the Airfryer and said he gave it 20 minutes and left it standing in the machine for another 10.IT WAS GORGEOUS! Really crispy and very moist AND cooked right thru'. I kept checking for 'pink bits' but there were none. The only problem was that the sauce dribbled and burnt inside the machine and took a lot of Cleaning (well ok, the dishwasher did most of it). I would recommend using less sauce, more a drier mixture to coat the chicken.<br>I have 'fried' cold leftover potatoes in it and they were great too.<br>All in all I like this product a lot and am glad I spent the money to get a really good Quality appliance.", "hash" : "a86355ca92e4449c493006baafae6a14", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "E.

Takes up about the same space as my old fryer.<br>2. Doesn't produce smells that last for hours unlike the old fryer.<br>3. No waste oil to change every so often (though as expected you still have to use some on your food to help it cook), this makes this very environmentally friendly as your not having to dispose of gallons of waste oil per year into landfill.<br>4. Significantly reduces the amount of oil used to cook things, which is alot healthier option.<br>5. Easier to clean than my old fryer as it the interior is covered in a non stick coating.<br>6. Not as much room as a large rectangular deep fat fryer, but about the same amount of room as a standard one.<br>7. Easy timer guide provided so you can set things up at a glance.<br><br>Overall I'm very impressed with the Philips air fryer, it is by far a much healthier and environmentally friendly fryer. The reason I chose this rather than the Tefal is that the Tefal has this rotating thing in the middle, meaning I can't cook fish/fish fingers in it as they would break up. The Philips air fryer doesnt have this, instead it blows hot air all around your food and in such a small space cooks extremely well.", "hash" : "ffddf136eb158c77e5e5eb7015d5c574", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "D.

I mean, the very practice of frying is hardly healthy now is it.  Hence the reason I've never owned any sort of fat fryer and only occasionally shallow fry food.  However, I was drawn to the fact that this is an 'air fryer', a technology that superheats air and allows the use of minimal amounts of oil or even none at all.<br><br>On receiving the Airfryer I was surprised at the size.  It isn't exactly small and it is a reasonable weight as well.  What I was very impressed with was the build quality.  The thing looks very swish in the corner of the kitchen, black and chic as if it will transform your chips into modern art pieces.  And taste wise I found it wasn't too far off!  But I digress.  Set up was easy and very well laid out in the easy start guide provided with the fryer.  The whole thing was out of the box, washed and set up ready for use in less than 20 minutes.<br><br>My first foray into airfrying was actually not chips but some chinese wonton dumplings that had been sitting in the freezer for some time.  Now the instructions on the packet were to fry them from frozen for 12 minutes, and after consulting the guide with the fryer that tied in with the time given for spring rolls which I deemed to be of similar construction and density.  So I pre-heated the airfryer for a few minutes and then popped the food in the basket.  Gave them a quick shake halfway through and then at the end of cooking I was presented with perfectly cooked, crisp and golden pork wonton.  Really nicely cooked and completely hassle free.<br><br>I have cooked self made chips, oven chips and self made potatoe cubes in the airfryer and all came out perfectly.  The oven chips I cooked at the same time as a pork steak I had marinaded, thanks to the handy metal divider that can be placed into the basket to cook separate foodstuffs at the same time.  The pork was cooked really well, not dried out and maintaining all the flavour I expected.  The oven chips were good too but it was the self made chips and cubes that were a revelation.  The instructions suggested using a teaspoon of oil on potatoes to prevent drying out but I decided a couple of sprays of the '1 cal' oil and a bit of garlic for seasoning would do the trick.  And it did.  Both chips and cubes tasted fantastic, no grease and all taste.  Much better than ovenchips.<br><br>On a practical level the airfryer is great.  The bottom section is the 'drawer' that pulls out and contains the food basket.  The main body of the thing houses the fans and heater etc.  It creates no smell at all when cooking, so no unpleasant oily odours and such.  The basket section is completely washable and even dishwashable (though I don't have one).  I've found it very easy to cook the stuff and then dump the whole basket and food drawer section straight into a bowl of soapy warm water.  When I come back it is a very simple matter to clean the thing and leave it to drain ready for more use.  The main body can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth.

The timer setting knob is not easy to set precisely but this doesn't matter as it is not necessary to time the cooking to more than plus or minus a minute anyway. The temperature setting knob is again not designed to be 100% precise as it just isn't necessary.  I did find the basket and it's casing to be a little on the heavy side, however, this isn't too much of a problem as once you've got the whole thing slid out you can release the basket and just use that.  One thing I was surprised at was how quiet the appliance is when cooking, I was expecting it to sound like a jet engine but it is more of a quiet hum or whirr.  cleaning, while not hard, can be annoying.  For example, when I tried to scrub the basket bottom the mesh ended up covered in little pieces of the washing up sponge.  This isn't a problem if you have a dish washer, but for those of us who haven't it can get frustrating.<br><br>Results<br>We tried cooking a few different things in it and overall were pleased with the results.  Things such as pre-packaged chicken in breadcrumb (nuggets and fillets) came out wonderfully crisp with a tender more succulent inside and much less fatty than when ovened or grilled.  Oven chips while still tasting like cardboard oven chips were still better than when cooked in a conventional oven and again less greasy.  Real fresh chips took us a while to get the hang of.  We originally tried using all purpose potatoes and 1 cal oil spray but they came out undercooked in places and not very nice.  However, once we swapped to Maris Piper potatoes and Sunflower oil they came out lovely.  I would recommend cooking in shorter bursts with plenty of shaking/mixing to ensure they cook evenly.<br><br>Conclusion<br>All in all the Airfryer was a pleasant surprise.  It worked well and was easy to use which is great for me as I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination.  The food all comes out a lot less fatty than when cooked in other ways which is very healthy and will be great for my husband who has diabetes and has to keep his fat intake down.  Although the price is high, it is certainly worth investing in.<br><br>Note:<br>I do have one concern however, there is no Safety cut-out when the basket and protective casing is pulled out.

It was something that I fancied trying but would probably never have bought for myself, so this was ideal for me.  I think the price is a little high unless you are a serious fryer, but that is down to personal choice.<br><br>I hadn't used a fryer for a long time as they were always messy and difficult to clean.  The Airfryer is so simple to clean, as the pull-out drawer has a detachable basket so it can all be washed very easily and quickly.<br><br>I have cooked a few lots of chips in it, which come out great, although I think it will take a bit of practice to get it right every time, and it does depend on the potatoes that you use.  Another reviewer suggested Maris Pipers are the best to use and I'd agree with that.<br><br>I've also cooked rostis in it, using the recipe from the booklet that comes with it.  They came out really well, and I'd definitely try some more of the Recipes.  Chicken nuggets and fish fingers came out well in the fryer too and were not greasy at all.<br><br>Because there is so little oil used it mostly evaporates with the heat and this helps to keep it clean.  All it really needs after use is a wipe down.  I think if you were to put too much oil in then over time the mesh in the basket could get a bit greasy, but the basket is easily removed so it's no problem to soak it to get it properly clean.<br><br>The timer is a basic dial type, which are never very accurate and it's quite awkward to reduce the time to less if you set it for a bit too long.  For the price, I think a digital timer and a better alarm would have been good but it's not a problem as you can always set the timer higher and use another timer to tell you when they are done and just stop it when you've had things in for long enough.<br><br>Because you're not frying in oil, it's so easy to just pull out the tray to shake the food to help it cook evenly without worrying about it splashing everywhere, and the fryer just keeps on going so you just put the drawer back in and it carries on with the cooking process.<br><br>On the subject of oil, the instructions state that olive oil should be used to coat the potatoes, and I have found that is a lot better than vegetable oil (as mentioned by another reviewer).  This could depend on what you are cooking and practice, but for basic chips it seems the best option.<br><br>It's a reasonably weighty product, but it's well-balanced as the motor is in the top of the fryer.  It's easy to lift and move around.  It also looks nice as it has a good shape and a sleek black casing.<br><br>In summary, I have found this an easy product to use, that gives you great, non-greasy food and looks good.", "hash" : "6473ac284be7ad0d3d4114012890951a", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Nicola in South Yorkshire \"nicola_in_southyorks\"", "authorLocation" : "UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A3OQKD6SJFVR5O/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b00b55d62de70060fed8" } }

In that respect it is quite similar to a Tefal product that I had once considered purchasing, other than learning of its reported problems. Both fryers require about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil, but where the Tefal requires that the oil be added to the fryer, the Philips requires that the food be either tossed in or brushed with oil before placing in the fryer. It does not require a great deal of surface space to use, but it is quite tall and storage in most cupboards could be an issue. No dust cover is provided or offered so worktop storage could be problematic. It is quite noisy in  use, due to the fan, but the timer is the clockwork type that emits a 'ding' when finished. Unless you are in quite close vicinity, or there is little background noise either from a TV, radio or the kids, you may not hear it. A digital timer with a more pronounced warning, would at this price break, have made rather more sense.<br><br>I had used a variety of electric fryers since experiencing an oil fire in a traditional fryer some years ago. Some lasted for 3-5 years, others rather less but none were in the same price league as this. It relies on a fan to draw in air from the top and pass it over an element not unlike that found in older electric kettles. The pan has a shaped segment in its base that is supposed to swirl the air around and to pass it back up through the food, cooking the food more or less evenly on both sides. It works to some extent but is far from perfect. If there is a single layer of something, it can perform quite well, but if there are multiple layers as with chips then it basically fails for reasons explained below,<br><br>The promises are many but performance in most cases fell rather short. When cooking chips, not the oven-ready type, despite cooking for the recommended time or more, shaking the contents as recommended after about 60% and again at about 80% of the time has elapsed, most were invariably still either mostly white or were browned only in a few places. However, it was often the case that corners were burned even though much of the chip looked uncooked. Sometimes, a few were still quite raw in places and the flavour and texture is quite different and may need time to be accepted. The only effective way to ensure even cooking is to turn each chip over so that its least cooked surfaces are nearer to the element - not the most time-efficient or practical solution. As most buyers will probably consider this as a chip fryer and nothing more, it is not ideal for the job. At its current price, even after Amazon reduced their prices by over 1/3 despite a rise in VAT, it is not the most cost-effective or simply the most effective solution. It is also seems rather slow; for example chips require about 12-15 minutes plus 3 minutes more to preheat which is about twice as long as in a deep fryer although the oil will need some time to heat. Steaks require about 10-12 minutes plus preheating time compared with about 3 or 4 in an electric grill, although the latter will need to be heated before use.<br><br>When cooking other things, like potato cakes - a family favourite - they cooked quite well if turned at about 2/3 of the time required. I did not use it with steaks or fish as I have a grill that I use for that purpose, but it was a consideration for the future. I have in the past made my own doughnuts and other fried confections and I purchased the AirFryer without any consideration that I would no longer be able to use it for that purpose. It is not suited for that type of cooking. I also often make my own crisps or game chips when entertaining and I doubt that this machine would be capable of doing that either. It is not therefore the complete solution for all domestic frying needs and you may also need a deep fat fryer for those jobs that the AirFryer is not best suited. If that is the case, why have two fryers when one will suffice?<br><br>However, after about 3-4 weeks' of use - about 8-10 uses in total, I noticed flecks of soft black plastic sticking to the metal base protector/heat reflector that is located under the pan and basket assembly. When washing the pan when last used, I noticed that its rubber feet had disintegrated such that about half of each was now missing! Having owned the item for less than 6 weeks, that is a major failing.<br><br>In consequence of its problems and failings I have had no option but to return it to Amazon for a refund. A replacement with another identical unit was not even considered.<br><br>The bottom line is that if it is a deep fryer that you need, you can buy better at a fraction of the price. If you need to cook steaks, fish, sausages etc, you can also buy an electric grill as well as a deep fryer and still save money. Between the two, there are many more jobs that they will undertake than this product can manage.<br><br>In brief, it does not perform well, is over-expensive, not fully featured and less than well designed. For its performance, it is not worth the price paid and cannot therefore be recommended unless you are a gadget hound who does not need it to cook the food it is supposedly designed to cook.

Frying is the process of cooking in fat or oil in a pan or griddle; the Philips Airfryer is a hot air oven. That is relevant to some of the poor results reported by other reviewers. If any part of the food is shielded from the blast of hot air it is not going to be cooked. With chips in particular, loading the basket more than about half-full makes even cooking difficuly to ensure, and the recommended shake halfway through cooking does not do the job. Especially with thin fries, it is better to interrupt cooking at least twice and turn the food over with a spatula.<br><br>In this household thin oven fries are usually cooked on a George Foreman grill, with fairly crispy and delicious results and with most of the fat collected in the drip tray. It does not seem to me that the Philips Airfryer does a better job, but nor does it do a worse job. Because we do not actually own a deep fryer, and have not done for many years, there are no super-fatty fries for the Airfryer to save us from.<br><br>Considered as an oven, the Airfryer is both fast and versatile. The timings given in the recipe book are suspect, leading to a certain amount of experimentation, and I think it would be huge advantage if there was a window so food could be observed during cooking. The appliance looks somewhat like a motorcycle helmet, and the transparent visor is sorely missed. However, in the short time the tall Philips has sat on our worktop it has cooked items as diverse as fishcakes and parsnips (love 'em) succesfully and quicker than a conventional oven would do. I believe the shorter warm-up and cooking times mean it is more energy-efficient as well.<br><br>This is a tough product to summarise. Any home with a full complement of kitchen appliances probably does not need it, and it's an awkward height to find storage for. It would make an impressive gift, but I'll never get it back in the packing.", "hash" : "7d7dee0de1d3fc4e06f0e76f22ff5458", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Old Timer", "authorLocation" : "Bedfordshire, England", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2AUJKSPHI718N/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b0dd55d62de70060ff98" } }

If you watch the video, that was when I had only just used it so you will see what I mean when I said I struggled a bit, however now I have done it a few times I am not having that problem any more, so if you end up struggling also, be patient and you will pick up the technique pretty fast.<br><br>Using the AirFryer is actually really easy, most things do not require oil, but some still do although a very small amount ie. wedges require half a teaspoon, I personally used sunflower oil.  Some foods you may want to experiment with timings etc.. however I used the exact instructions to cook myself some potato wedges and it cooked them perfectly, they tasted great and seemed.... fresh and healthy, no grease on them at all.<br><br>My favourite thing about this AirFryer is that it has a timer that will cut off the heat when it reaches '0', this is great as I'm easily distracted and often burn my food.  Please note that when cooking, if the AirFryer is being used from cold make sure you add 3 minutes to the timer to let it \"pre-heat\".<br><br>As for Cleaning, it's really easy, just pull the main compartment out then either put it in the dishwasher or a quick scrub will do, just make sure it's cooled down first as it can get extremely hot.<br><br>Overall I'm really pleased with this product, it's easy to use, cooks really well and it's healthy & cleaner. so top marks from me!", "hash" : "1ada1303cd1fd2ddfc0b144083f1578f", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "MyKeyReviews", "authorLocation" : "Hampshire, UK.", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A23O6Y6BCFE808/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522afb355d62de70060fe6e" } }

There's no way this is getting broken in the post.<br>- Very sleek, shiny and cool-looking if you have a modern style kitchen.<br>- easy to use. Seriously, any idiot can do it. There's a quick start guide that'll have you up and frying in no time.<br>- The food tastes awesome. Not greasy, not dry, just great.<br>- You can cook pretty much anything in it, from cheese-filled peppers to garlic mushrooms to classic sausages and chips.<br>- The tray divider is a great idea and lets you cook two different parts to a meal, or indeed two different meals if you have fussy children, without one food getting contaminated with the taste of another.<br>- It's healthy! As healthy as frying gets. It's fantastic to be able to cook all these foods without adding oil. And even though they advise half a tablespoon of oil with homemade chips, try using just a couple of sprays of frylight 1-calorie oil and you should be fine.<br>- The recipe book that comes with it has some nice ideas and unusually it also includes the calories and fat for each recipe, which is fantastic news.<br><br>CONS:<br>- It's BIG. And HEAVY. It takes up a lot of worktop space, and if you decide to keep it in a cupboard instead, you'll most likely need someone with decent muscles to take it in and out.<br>- It's BLACK. Which may look fine in modern style kitchens but it looks very out of place in my nice white country-style kitchen. White or silver or cream options would be useful.<br>- The recipe book is filled with quite a few things that I think not many people would eat, and could do with Recipes for southern fried chicken and doughnuts. I think they'd be more useful than some of the random things in the book.<br>- There is another popular fryer that does the same job and it's a bit cheaper.<br><br>So there are a few things that could be improved on with this, but all in all I'd say it's a fab product and if you're considering buying it then go ahead!", "hash" : "8b84e8201ff3a87ce4430df2df5a844a", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Miss \"crazyminx\"", "authorLocation" : "Coventry", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2SVP8SRC53OG8/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b3ad55d62de70061025f" } }

That was an 800g batch - the recommended max although I could have put a few more in.<br><br>The process is simple.  Just cut the potatoes after peeling.  add a small slosh of oil and coat the chips.  Pour them into the Airfryer having preheated for 3 minutes.  Shake after 9 minutes and leave for another 9 minutes.  Then perfect chips.  Not greasy but crispy but really tasty chips.  You could actually taste the potato unlike with floury oven chips.  I was really pleased.<br><br>Cleaning consisted of bunging the tray and net into the dishwasher - takes up quite a lot of room and that's it.  The outside of the machine did not get at all dirty.  There was a faint smell of cooking but no smell of chip oil.  The unit is quite noisy but not bad enough to disturb.<br><br>So, this was great.  I am looking forward to cooking spring rolls next.  The recipe book does all sorts including fish fingers (home made) etc.  The separator allows you to cook 2 individual items at the same time.

It takes up quite a space on the work-top and if you move it it has a tendency to leave the feet behind.<br>You do get a recipe book with 30 Recipes, including brownies, but you can't cook anything greasy, like sausages, in it. I experimented making chips, I used fresh and frozen ones, and I found that you always needed to add some oil; frozen chips are coated with oil to stop them sticking together but it didn't seem to be enough. I also found that you needed to shake them more than the recommended once otherwise they were cooked unevenly. The chip-basket unclips from the drawer to allow you to shake the contents; the drawer has silicone feet to allow it to sit on a normal worktop. The chip-basket and drawer can be put in a dishwasher.  Results were OK but really no different to cooking oven-chips in the oven(it is a fan oven). Philips claim there are \"no nasty frying odours\", they may not be \"nasty\" but there were odours and the unit is noisy, noisier, for example, than a typical microwave oven.<br>There is a divider for the chip-basket, however when I tried to cook some chicken-drumsticks and chips together I found I couldn't shake the chips and when I tipped the basket out at the end, the divider, which is heavy metal, fell out, luckily not smashing the plate!  The AirFryer did however cook the frozen chicken drumsticks very well.<br>Philips state that snacks that can be prepared in an oven can be prepared in the AirFryer; you can even bake a cake provided the cake-tin fits in the chip-basket.<br>Philips currently offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, you get your money back if you are not satisfied.

People tend to gravitate towards it when the arrive in my kithen, because it looks so cool.<br><br>As for performance, the first thing I like about it is its so easy to use and quick. It is about a third ( sometimes half ) the cooking time normal. I was disappointed at first as I thought it would not give a deep fried taste, as it seems to me to work more like a high powered air oven. With air being circulated through the cooker at a high speed to cook food. However the results so far have been delicious, and people have commented how tasty the food is.<br>You just pop the food in the fryer basket, in the drawer, turn the knob to the cooking time and thats it ! The basket seems quite large , so you should get reasonable amount of food cooked , probably ok for about 4 people. It comes with a basic instruction cooking times plus a small recipe book.<br>So far I have only done basic items like chips, pakora, fried mushrooms etc but all have tasted good. You pull the drawer out half way and give a small shake, and none of my food has stuck.<br>It comes out fat free and nice and light. My only problem is sometimes getting the times right, the first time I put frozen chips for 15 mins and it was too long and they burnt. However Its easy to set the time a bit less then pop them back in for another two mins with the turn of the knob.<br><br>Its also easy to clean, with just the basket and drawer needing Cleaning ( which are nice & lightweight ).<br><br>Overall I really like it, the recipe book has recipes for chicken and even brownies, which I will give a go soon and report back. So it seems a bit more verstile than just a fryer. I find the food tastes nicer, its so quick and easy that I really like it. I will keep updated but so far I really recommend it, it is pricey but if you are watching your fat intake, want quicket healthier food it might be a good investment.", "hash" : "7498b44c5720370d2dece5c8b728a683", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "pepemia", "authorLocation" : "scotland", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A9Z013CK7DRXN/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b31855d62de7006101cc" } }

Supermarket labelled 'versatile' potatoes work fine.<br>- When cutting the potatoes after peeling them, put them in a bowl of water and then drain them to remove excess starch.<br>- Dry them with a tea towel.<br>- Add half a tablespoon of olive oil to a bowl and, a handful at time, coat the cut potatoes in the oil.<br>- Give the basket 2-3 shakes during the cooking process.<br>- Adjust the timer to cook them for longer if necessary.<br><br>Cooking a very large portion of chips for two adults takes approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>In summary, this is an expensive lifestyle cooking appliance.

It not only looks good, is healthy, but for many things it has replaced our oven. Probably not suitable for a family but great for cooking for one or two. To start off we had a go at chips, this is why we got it. I have never liked the deep fryer and pan cooked chips are smelly and unhealthy. We started off without adding any fat at all. The result for me was a bit too dry. Still a good chip butty with lashings of tomato sauce though! We found that the recommended spoonfull of oil worked a treat. The chip pan has finally been sacked in our house!<br><br>However this wonderful machine is not just for chips. It is a mini oven. We have heated scampi up and they tasted great. We have also warmed up croissants. As there is a seperator we were able to have the scampi in one side and the chips in the other. There was plenty for two people. It takes 3 minutes to heat up then 20 minutes to cook chips. It suggests shaking the basket every so often. The smells emanating from it are minimal compared to a chip pan.<br><br>Cleaning is very easy, even when you some oil in the cooking. Wipes off easily. The timer is brilliant and automatically cuts off when it has got to zero. This is great for people like me who forget the oven is on and end up burning things!<br><br>In conclusion I highly recommend this item. It has very quickly become an important part of our kitchen. It is healthier than a fat fryer and more energy efficient than a normal oven. It is a great little oven that looks fantastic as well.

It also purports to allow the user to cook a vast variety of other things - dumplings, chicken, and so on. This claim is actually reasonable, as the AirFryer, with a coil at the top, and an air-circulation system, is effectively a tiny oven.<br><br>Actually, it isn't that tiny. Its counter footprint is roughly the width, depth and height of two standard blender/food processors side by side, which can be a problem in a kitchen with limited counter space. This is exacerbated by the weight of the thing - at 10 kilos, it is sufficiently heavy that you won't want to be moving it about too much. On the plus side, the top of the device is flat, and so returns a little of the flat space if you need it - though it's probably best not to put anything on it during use.<br><br>The styling of the device reminds me of a fat plastic egg, in a shiny black; it doesn't look out of place amongst all the other kitchen appliances, and black always looks decently sleek - but nor does it jump out. Mine also has two large stickers on it, which aren't evident in the product photograph, but look too awkward to remove.<br><br>The handle visible about halfway up the egg is actually the handle for the food tray. On pulling the tray out, one finds a surprisingly compact metal area, with a drip space beneath. There is also a metal divider, which can be used to separate different types of food, should you desperately want to make chips and (say) chicken nuggets at the same time.  The tray area appears small at first glance, but takes roughly two medium sized baking potatoes worth of material (assuming they are fairly thinly sliced.<br>So, it's heavy, looks a bit odd, and has a pointless divider - but does it work? In a word, yes. I peeled and sliced a couple of potatoes , which fit roughly into the food tray, popped them in the tray, and then set the temperature Using the temperature dial) and the required time (using the large dial above the handle). A quiet hooverish sound ensued, and the timer made a satisfying ticking sound.  After half the required time, I pulled the tray out via the handle - the potato fragments showed signs of cooking, so I shook them about, and then put the tray back in the device.<br><br>After the total set time, the timer makes a fairly loud `ding', indicating it is time to remove the contents. Having pulled them out, and dumped onto a plate, I can say that the first batch were excellent, and largely indistinguishable from fry chips.  Having read a few negative reviews, I made several more batches over the next few days, and noted that results were a little inconsistent - sometimes the potato slices would be unevenly cooked, whilst other attempts produced excellent food. It seems that one or two `flips' are useful, allowing the user to monitor the state of their food, and also increase/decrease time as appropriate.<br>It's a shame there isn't a way to do this automatically, or a means of checking the state of ones food without pulling it from the AirFryer. This is especially true when the user steps outside of the Recipes provided, and starts putting other things into the AirFryer, without knowing exactly how long they will take to cook; an `'auto cook' option, as sometimes seen in microwaves, would have helped.<br><br>That said, the overall results are excellent, and the chips I made were uniformly very tasty.  This is a fun gadget, and certainly occasioned a bit of kitchen-conversation from friends curious about how it worked. It also makes very good chips. If you're looking to replace a chip pan, this is probably a good choice, but given the counter real estate it demands, it may be a bit niche.<br><br>Overall, it's easy and fun to use, and the end products are satisfyingly tasty but I think it's an indulgence, rather than a kitchen necessity.", "hash" : "9cd83e091005f27ecc212e88e85ab4b3", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Christopher Meadows", "authorLocation" : "York, UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2IW05U6SV3PHH/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b02b55d62de70060feed" } }

If you're planning on having the AirFryer permanently out on your kitchen work-surface, then expect the fryer to take up a lot of this surface space.  When you open up the drawer, you realise that considering the amount of room the AirFryer takes up, it doesn't actually allow for very large portions to be cooked at once.  The basket drawer only really allows for around four medium sized portions of chips, or if doing two separate items such as fish & chips, then it would only cater for just two people's portions.  So, if you're planning on using this AirFryer to cook for a family of more than two people, then be warned that you won't be able to cook up all the items at once for the meal!<br><br>The overall Design of the AirFryer is very modern and contemporary with its polished hard-plastic black exterior.  This is ideal for a contemporary, modern or minimalist kitchen; but not very fitting for a more rustic or `country' style of kitchen (my wife thinks it looks like a miniature spaceship).<br><br>The AirFryer is incredibly easy to use from the outset.  There's no complex instructions or any daunting amount of cooking options or buttons.  It's a simple case of set the temperature and set the timer...and you're done!<br><br>It's always good to preheat the AirFryer beforehand for a good three minutes or so.  When doing so, be careful to take out the metal separator from the basket beforehand, otherwise you run the risk of burning yourself when extracting it after it's been heated to a high temperature (yep, been there, done that).<br><br>The AirFryer is very easy to clean after use.  Simply wash the removable basket in warm, soapy water and wipe out the drawer.<br><br>The AirFryer is not a 100% oil free fryer, so don't think that you'll be able to cook everything without having any oil in the house.  All of the homemade chips, wedges, roasties etc require a thin coating of oil before placing them into the fryer - usually around one level tablespoon will do the job.  Even though oil is used (and remember it could always be olive oil) this is still a far healthier option in comparison to deep fat frying.  Even roasting potatoes in an oven would usually use more than a tablespoons worth of oil, so this is certainly a cheaper and healthier way of cooking these foods.<br><br>Chips turn out well from the AirFryer, with little to no grease on them and they can be cooked to just the right crispy level to suit your taste.  However, the final result isn't hugely dissimilar to using the oven to cook the chips or wedges, so don't expect miracles here!<br><br>The recipe book that comes included with the AirFryer is very simple and easy to follow and was compiled to show how to obtain the best results from the AirFryer.  However, in places the Recipes are a little too basic, missing off vital specifics, such as the type of sugar to use when baking brownies in the AirFryer (i.e. castor sugar should be used).  So don't expect superb Quality Recipes from this small but handy book.<br><br>Portion sizes are another aspect of the AirFryer that needs to be highlighted.  The recipe book offers up dishes stating how many they will cater for.  However, if you were to prepare these meals to the portion sizes that they recommend, then you'd barely feed an ant with each portion (ok...so slight exaggeration there).  Twelve portions from a 15cm diameter brownie?  Surely you jest sir!  Four individual meals from four drumsticks?...I don't think I've ever had a meal that consisted of just one drumstick with chips.<br><br>All in all, the AirFryer offers a healthy way of cooking a wide (and relatively unexpected) variety of foods - from chips, to chicken wings, to quiches, to brownies.  However, if cooking for a family consisting of more than just two people, then be warned that only a very limited amount can be cooked in the AirFryer at once.", "hash" : "386b6c7b9d4761a91186f40500015b80", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Chris Hall \"DLS Reviews\"", "authorLocation" : "Cardiff, Wales", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/ANBU5899VH9G2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522afd255d62de70060fe94" } }

I am impressed with the healthy and speedy method of frying by hot air circulation.  As a vegetarian, I mainly use the AirFryer for potatoes but it can be used for meat, fish and chicken as well as frozen foods.  Snacks that can be prepared in the oven can also be cooked in the AirFryer.<br><br>The AirFryer comes with easily understandable written instructions and diagrams so it makes frying extremely easy.  Phillips claim that the appliance can be used by children of 8 years or over provided that they have been shown how to use the AirFryer properly. It really is simple to use and also very convenient. In addition, it is easy to clean as the basket and pan can be rinsed in soapy water.  Another positive point is that there is no lingering fatty smell that is the case with deep fat fryers.<br><br>When frying home made chips, I find that the AirFryer works best for just two adult portions of chips (about 3 medium sized potatoes or two very large ones).  I have put in a third portion but even though it was below the MAX indicator level, I found that there was a more uneven distribution of cooking and some chips were hard.<br><br>Overall I am very impressed with this Phillips AirFryer but my only reservation is the price.

It basically does the same job, but faster, using less power and taking up only a fraction of the space of a full sized oven. I will be taking it in the caravan with me this summer as my most essential bit of kit - it will beat the caravan gas oven hands down.<br><br>While the promotional material suggests that this appliance is a healthier version of a chip frier and not much else, I think Philips have undersold it's other abilities. Yes, it does great french fries, but I have used it far more for cooking pies, beef burgers, falafels, pizza, oven chips, frozen roasting parsnips, roasting potatoes, battered oven-bake fish fillets, yorkshire puddings, salmon fillets, pretty much any frozen product that you can cook in the conventional oven, and even naan breads. It cooks in about half the time of a conventional fan-assisted oven (partly because it heats up in about three minutes) but mostly beacuse the unit re-circulates the hot air round and through the food and is far more efficient than a normal oven.<br><br>One point that I think needs mentioning is the built-in air filter - I was expecting there to be less fumes in my kitchen but I noticed no difference so I think the air filter part of the advertising is a bit misleading and having the filter seems to make very little difference.<br><br>The promotional material focuses mostly on the units ability to cook fries. I see that a lot of people have complained that it doesn't cook the fries well and they come out brown in places and undercooked in others. I found out the hard way that you have to cut the fries very thin (about 8mm by 8mm) and you have to follow the instructions in the main receipe booklet to get the perfect result other wise you'll get the same initial outcome that I did. Here's what to do:<br><br>Peel Maris Piper potatoes (max about 6 medium potatoes)<br>Use a french fry cutter (or cut very finely by hand (8mm x 8mm)<br>Rinse the fries under running water in a colander<br>Tip onto a clean tea-towel and gently pat dry.<br>Measure about 1 dessert spoon of olive oil into a large bowl<br>Add the fries and toss gently in the oil.<br>Heat the frier to 150 degrees<br>Add the fries and cook for 5 minutes<br>Remove from flyer and allow to cool<br>Turn the frier up to 200 degrees<br>Add half the fries and cook for 5 minutes<br>Open the drawer, unclip the food basket, toss the fries gently<br>Put back in the fryer for about another 5 minutes or until cripy and golden.<br>Repeat for the 2nd half of the batch.<br><br>DO NOT overfill the basket or the air can't circulate and you'll get burn bits and undercooked bits!<br><br>Overall, I'd give this fab gadget a 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for the rediculous price tag.

It's very sleek and well designed, and is a good bit smaller than any deep fat fryer I've seen in the past. It can be used to cook many different types of food such as chicken, red meat and of course chips. The designers have even though of what would happen if you wanted to cook steak and chips at the same time, and therefore have included a removable separator for the frying basket.<br><br>The only downside I could see with the design was that it may be too easy to detach the frying basket from the base (and drip tray) of the fryer, as you generally carry these around as one unit. However, the button for detaching these is right where you would normally have your thumb when holding it by the handle! Therefore, if you aren't careful, you could end up with a rather heavy bit of metal tumbling towards the floor!<br><br>Once it is all set up (and this doesn't take long as it's only a matter of removing the stickers and giving it a wipe over with a cloth), all you need to do is place the food in the basket and select the appropriate temperature and time. Included with the AirFryer is a handy guide which gives the recommended settings for a range of different foods.<br><br>It is slightly nosier than I would have expected (probably similar to the noise an extractor fan would make) and can generate quite a bit of steam which comes out a vent at the back. The base of the unit also gets quite warm, but again, this is only to be expected.<br><br>All this would have been totally irrelevant though if the food had come out a soggy mess or inedible boards. However, I'm glad to say that it didn't, otherwise I'd have had no tea tonight! From a taste point of view, the chips tasted much the same as if they'd been done in the oven (maybe slightly less dried out) and cooked in a much shorter time period. Of course the main advantage though is that they weren't full of grease, and so this defiantly has to be the healthier option of \"frying\" food!", "hash" : "28dad2d0c160557d5a07c6f6f852cce1", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "McStick", "authorLocation" : "United Kingdom", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A19288K6X7SEYH/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b3ad55d62de70061025b" } }

Due to Health problems I was advised not to have chips, but I love my chips, so some time ago I purchased an Actifry which I loved until after 22 months it blew up with a puff of smoke. It was rather expensive so getting only 22 months use from it I felt it was a waste of money, and I was VERY reluctant to repeat the experience. I considered the Philips airfryer but feared a repeat of the actifry experience, then I saw Amazon had reduced the price and the Philips had a 2year warranty so I took the plunge. The actifry had an element of thin wire, like a toaster, the Philips has a much more robust element, like the grill on a main cooker, a confidence builder straight away. I have as yet only tried the basics, my beloved chips which turned out a little over done following the instructions, a lower temp and less time on the second attempt resulted in perfect chips. Others have described it as noisy, it isn`t silent but I wouldn`t say it was noisy, it`s easy to set up and use, doesn`t smell and doesn`t get outwardly too hot.. I am so far very pleased with the fryer and only time will tell how long it lasts.

Whilst the Philips AirFryer is a lot quicker, 12 minutes as opposed to 40 minutes for the Tefal, it does entail a lot more attention. Because the chips lie on top of each other, the portions that are not exposed to the hot air do not brown. To prevent this, one needs to remove the container after six minutes, give the contents a good shake and cook for six minutes more. I have found that this can still leave sections that are not brown and shake the container twice, once after four and again eight minutes. To improve the flavour, I cut the potatoes into chips, dry them off, and then brush them over with Olive Oil before cooking. It takes a while to get used to, but is a lot easier and cleaner than using a deep fat fryer, and wins over the Tefal Actifry because of the time saving.", "hash" : "d5ae4be8edc2ff34c5377712fa6ee635", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "David Lambert", "authorLocation" : "Monmouth", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2YPZU33NZ1AOT/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b76e55d62de700610621" } }

It's pretty heavy, has a very nice, polished finish and overall it really feels like it's a good piece of equipment.<br><br>And it is.  For chips.  First word of warning is that the cooking times in the booklet are too short.  You need to preheat it first, for about five minutes.  Second tip is you need to shake it during cooking.  Not once as they suggest, but several times.  And if you follow these tips, and make sure that when making real chips you coat them in oil first, then it makes a really nice plate of chips.  And frozen chips are even better.  You can have them all evenly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Great.<br><br>But now the down side.  Although the unit itself is pretty big, the basket is quite small.  In fact only really big enough for two helpings.  If you put more in, then they stick together, no matter how much you shake.  There's also a divider for the basket so that you can cook two different products.  We tried to do fish and chips this way, but it was pretty poor.  The chips were undercooked and the fish overcooked, even though we did our best.<br><br>So overall, particularly considering the price, it's a disappointment.

The paddle used to break up whatever was in it, so when it started playing up (the lid catch broke), I read the reviews for this and thought I'd give it a go. It's soooooo much better. My first attempt at chips (coated in half a tablespoon of oil) were fantastic. So nice that I have them for tea too !<br><br>The first time I used it I followed the timing guidelines in the recipe book. A couple of the chips (and I mean only a couple) were very slightly underdone, but a lovely golden colour. So the second time I used it I cooked them for a couple of minutes longer at 150 and then turned the heat up to 200. They were perfect. I also took the basket out and shook them a couple of times more that it says to, (remember to take the basket out to shake as the pan part is heavy and could do some damage if it drops off on your foot).<br><br>It says in the instructions to put the chips into the basket one at a time so as not to poor any excess oil in. I just tipped them in (remember, they only had half a tablespoon of oil anyway) and the excess oil, what bit of it there was, drips into the pan below.<br><br>Slimming World chips are syn free if I were to use Frylight, but to me it's worth the \"syns\" to use the little bit of oil for a better tasting chip. They are still loads healthier :)<br><br>In summary it's a good sturdy machine and nice to look at. The basket and pan are dishwasher safe (always a plus) and so far I'm really happy with it. Seems a lot of money just to do chips, but to me it's worth it and I'm sure I'll do other things in it.<br><br>A lot cheaper than in Argos.<br><br>Cooks quicker and better than the Actifry, and beats it by miles.<br><br>Get one :)", "hash" : "9a76cd0ed5378a9eedf066bdb85797ee", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Kezweazel \"Kez\"", "authorLocation" : "Derbyshire, UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/AU24XAQSZWLHZ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522afd255d62de70060fe9c" } }

As this has no moving parts and no lid, that would not be a problem.<br><br>We are a relatively healthy eating household but my kids do not like oven chips because they are too dry apparently.  So I decided to opt for a healthier dryer for that purpose mainly.

It is more of a small convection oven and that being said I have successfully cooked small individual frozen pizzas in it (in around 10 mins) and small pies etc.  It will cook most things you would normally think of baking so long as they are not too fatty (such as sausages) as the high fat content can cause splattering to the element and this would be difficult to clean.<br><br>So, chips!  Homemade chips are not the best in this fryer.  The instructions state you must soak the potato chips for 30 mins, dry and apply oil by hand to coat them.  Initially I tried doing this by using my olive oil pump spray - this did not apply enough oil and the chips were left very dry and chewy.  my second attempt I did by applying the oil in a bowl and mixing it through by hand as suggested, the results were better but still a little tasteless and chewy.  Oven chips fair a little better but unfortunately, there just seems to be no real substitute for 'proper' fried chips.<br><br>The bonus of this is that it heats up quickly, cooks quickly and with less fat.  It is therefore not only healthier but probably more economical than putting the oven on every time.  The jury is still out about chips fried in this but we are still experimenting with different oils and different chips!<br><br>It looks great in the kitchen though, although it is large.", "hash" : "dad6d70ee08ce012307e0d3666a43cd5", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "TheShopaholic", "authorLocation" : "UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/AZCODQSGQ44KQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b02b55d62de70060fef2" } }

However, real battered food such as deep fried fish and chips doesn't taste the same, no matter what you do to it.<br><br>If you want to know what the AirFryer really does, it's like a gigantic fan-heater where all the heat is blown across your food, dehydrating it a little and cooking it a lot. It has the same effect, in heat terms, as cooking it hot oil, but it does so without the oil. This is far, far healthier, means that it doesn't taste of last week's oil (important if you are doing home-style fish and chips one week and Chinese spring rolls the next), much quicker, and (I'm fairly sure) uses less electricity. It also means that the oil will never boil over, as it did eventually to every one of our deep-fat fryers, spoiling the filter and generally rendering the device unpleasant.<br><br>In terms of smell, it isn't entirely odour free. Especially if you are cooking chips, onto which you need to rub a little oil before you start, unless they are frozen chips from a packet, there is _some_ odour, though nothing that an extractor fan won't cope with and nothing at all like the odour of a deep fat fryer.<br><br>Cooking salmon is an absolute joy, whether fresh or from frozen, and the result is beautifully crisp. Mushrooms, similar, and many other kinds of food that suffer easily from being overcooked.<br><br>However:<br>If you want battered haddock and thick, pub style chips, it doesn't really do that. You can put batter on your haddock, and you have to rub some oil onto the chips, but, at least in all our experiments, you really can't get to something which is 'just like' fish and chips. As a way of serving potatoes, AirFried chips are great -- but don't expect picky children to accept them as 'just the same as the chip shop'. On the other hand, pretty much by definition, you can't have all the benefits of fat-free cooking and still have the fat.<br><br>There's just one other downside: this thing is huge! It's about the same width as a traditional deep fat fryer, maybe even a little less, but it towers to almost twice the height. Measure carefully before you order.<br><br>Otherwise, strongly recommended -- from Health, Safety, ecological and economical perspectives, this is a winner.", "hash" : "98c5b6858b9d242b3baee3be862ea2c5", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Martin Turner \"Martin Turner\"", "authorLocation" : "Marlcliff, Warwickshire, England", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A24QMF2FYXW109/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b04755d62de70060ff09" } }

I use Maris Piper, cut large; blanche them in boiling water for 3 minutes; let the water evaporate off and cool; then I use some olive oil to cover them (using my hands!) and cook them for around 15 minutes at 160 followed by 15 minutes at 180. They never stick, they are crisp outside and fluffy and flavoursome inside.  THEY ARE MUCH BETTER THAN DEEP FRIED CHIPS - I know because I have Lincat professional double fryers - and they are now in the garage.  I even now use it for my roast potatos.<br><br>I've also been experimenting. Because they are \"Air\" they are also great at things like warming croissants.  Bring the temp up to max then pop a croissant in for 2 to 3 minutes.  Crisp just like in France.  Also ..... chestnuts!  30 minutes at 160.  I've also done some great Char Siu Pork.

The promise of less use of oil not only is good on Health grounds but also promises much reduced smells in the kitchen.<br><br>I opened the box to examine the fryer, cleaned it in readyness to make tempura fish and veg.  After all, one review claimed it could do so easily.  Once you get into the preparation mode, you question \"where does the oil go\" for frying the food.  The basket has a clear \"no oil\" symbol stamped into it.  The Philips website has tempura Recipes but they are not for use with the air fryer.  The fish recipe in the handbook uses breadcrumbs instead of a wet batter.  Then when you dig into reviews and articles about the airfryer on the internet, we began to realise that the claim about being able to cook tempura is based on a single unsubstanciated quote (including here on Amazon) which is requoted throughout internet sites without question.  Well, we did find an australian review which said pretty much what I began to suspect at this point, that the airfryer is not much use for cooking wet batter foods.<br><br>As this is my prime requirement, luckily not having used it as yet, I repacked the fryer back into its original wrapping and box, and am now waiting for collection on its return to the vendor for a refund.<br><br>I appreciate that my requirement is a very narrow use of this product which, in fairness to Philips, it does not claim to satisfy.  Indeed, the claims it makes for those items in its recipe booklet look indeed very credible and good.

That's a lot of 1 star ratings!  Here is what I think is happening.<br><br>Most of the 1 star reviews were written between December and March most of the 5 star reviews were written between March and November.  Could this be something to do with harvest times and storage?<br><br>The advertising material suggests you can take a potato from your cupboard, chop it up, soak it, dry and oil it and airfry it for 20 mins and you will get chips that look like the photo.  For me this couldn't have been further from the truth. Mine were dry, burnt on the outside but soggy and gelatinous in the middle.  I used Maris Piper potatoes and tried all of the various methods given in the various books and leaflets with minimal success.  King Edward's are meant to be even better for fried chips but were equally disastrous.<br><br>I was about to send the fryer back but came across an article on the web that suggested that supermarkets stored potatoes so that they retained their looks but didn't cook in the same way as fresh.  So I tried different potatoes from different sources and had more success.  The best I have found so far are Rooster red potatoes.  When double cooked as in the recipe book (not the instructions) they produce an edible chip that doesn't go soggy for about 5 minutes.  Rooster potatoes cooked as wedges are quite nice but, like the chips, they taste more like baked potato than fried.  This makes sense - a lot of the fried taste comes from the high oil content and from the fact that there is a large volume of hot oil in close contact with the potato.<br><br>So I would make two suggestions: 1) Set your expectations appropriately.  If you want chips that look like the photos and taste like chip shop chips then keep the packaging to send it back!  If you want lowish fat freshly cooked potatoes that are pleasant to eat then go for it.  2) You must be prepared to experiment and search for potatoes and cooking methods that work for you.<br><br>Other observations:<br>I believe the airfryer needs potatoes that are more suited to baking so dry varieties may do better.  I will try Melody and Romano varieties next.<br>Adding oil with an oil sprayer after the regular shaking seems to help.<br>Adding paprika, jerk seasoning, asafoetida or turmeric to the oil adds flavour missing from the frying process but watch the turmeric; it stains everything it touches.<br>Adding vinegar makes the chips go soggy very quickly.<br>Amazon's returns policy says \"Defective Merchandise: includes any item that does not perform as expected\" so should be returnable.  Philips included a 60 day no quibble return slip in my airfryer.<br>I plan to keep my airfryer for convenience even though it doesn't do much more that my Neff circotherm oven. I will also keep my deep fat fryer for the occasional treat when I must have real chips, e.g. with steak.<br>The airfryer does cook Tikka and the like but makes a real mess.  This may help if you don't own a grill or an oven.<br>The price for what you get is outrageous if I wasn't absolutely desperate I would have sent it back and if I have a choice I will avoid Philips in the future.", "hash" : "1391239f071cd613b1a0b8564d3a7ecd", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Peter Williams \"Devon\"", "authorLocation" : "UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A129VNDX9XGZLQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b95155d62de7006107ff" } }

Not that I ate them in excess, but I guess as one gets older the body metabolism gets a little slower trying to convert those fat rich, high calorie foods into meaningful energy & muscle. So much so that I soon gained weight despite of a fairly active lifestyle.<br><br>Since I started this diet over a year ago I have lost around 3 stones; and after purchasing a treadmill & weights and pushing myself through a more vigorous routine of exercise, my middle-aged body  is beginning to look a little leaner at last. But I still afford myself the odd monthly trip to the chip-shop, as the home-made chips I bung in the oven covered in Fry-Lite, doesn't quite match up to expectations despite the health-benefits.<br><br>So I started to look for alternatives to oven cooking, and after some debate between this fryer & the popular Tefal, I decided to go with this purely based on the fact it has no paddle to stir the chips, which may well be a good thing to begin with, reviews suggest that over time the paddle does snap off and is quite expensive to replace.<br><br>I won't go into great detail about the AirFryer, because this has been discussed in many other reviews here. All I wanted was a device that cooked chips better than any oven, and cooked them more healthily than any deep-fryer. But my first 3 attempts at cooking chips in the AirFyer did not lift my hopes! Using ordinarily baking potatoes, and then new potatoes, I followed the instructions from the User Guide, as well as experimented based on comments from reviews here, and tried to cook the perfect chip.<br><br>But despite trying different combinations, the end result was quite disappointing both visually and in taste. But not being one to throw in the towel, I bought some Maris Piper potatoes and did the following:-<br><br>1/ peeled them & chipped them using a medium-cut chipper<br>2/ soaked them in a pan of water for around 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>3/ draining them from a sieve and letting them dry out naturally (15 minutes)<br>4/ put them in a colander for a final shake, and then doused them with a few squirts of FryLite- shaking as I go.<br>5/ Put them in the AirFryer basket and set the temperature to 160, with a cooking time of 15 minutes (I didn't both with pre-heat!)<br>6/ After the time was up, I increased the temperature to 180 and a cooking time of a further 10-15 minutes. On both cooking occasions I made a point of stirring (rather than shaking) the chips  with a wooden spoon every few minutes.<br>7/ On completion, I let the cooked chips \"rest\" in the basket for a minute or so before taking them out and serving.<br><br>My first words after eating the first couple of chips was something like \"OMG!!!\"  They were absolutely perfect!! Crispy & well textured; visually pleasing with a golden brown finish; they were firm & not limp or soggy like my first 3 attempts with baking potatoes. These Maris Piper chips were totally spot on, and I have to confess to saying these were the best tasting low-fat chips I have ever had! They taste even better than chip-shop chips as well, primarily because there's no fatty aftertaste, and above all I could eat these with a healthy conscience :)<br><br>I know this fryer has a multitude of other cooking capabilities, and I will looking forward to trying them out. But in terms of cooking the perfect healthy chip, this is most definitely the fryer to have! The thing to always bear in mind when cooking your particular perfect chip, is to \"NEVER GIVE UP!\"<br><br>Experiment, and read the reviews of others here, and you won't go wrong.<br><br>5/5 Recommended", "hash" : "058f87762a91e2ba818081db35f8a3ee", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "HanaBi \"sonatine97\"", "authorLocation" : "England, UK", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A1QQAQVB43NGJX/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522afee55d62de70060febc" } }

She's also experimented with her own coating for chicken pieces - again much healthier than the bought kind.  An added bonus for me is that the amount of residual grease and mess is minimal compared with either a deep fat fryer or trays of greasy food in the ordinary oven - everything is really well contained in the unit, and easy to wash afterwards, in the the sink or dishwasher. Having a timer is another 'plus' - you can go and do other things during cooking and know you won't come back to a kitchen full of smoke!

We do not fry very often which means either replacing the oil every time or using slightly stale oil which mars taste and produces odours!<br><br>I did my usual research (for which Amazon is invaluable) comparing the Tefal Actifryer to the Phillips Airfryer.  The main difference seemed to be in build quality, reliability and the overall price of the unit.  The footprint (which is smaller), aesthetics (sleek, modern and quite discrete sitting in the corner of the kitchen) along with price, functionality and the 60 day no quibble money-back guarantee all swayed me towards the AirFryer.<br><br>After receiving the AirFryer from the as ever reliable Amazon I had the unit set up within minutes and set on 3 minute preheat to \"fry\" some chips.  I'd soaked the potatoes beforehand and \"fried\" a full basket for about 18 mins on 180.  The colour was great however they were not as crispy as I expected.  However, having read some reviews I think with a bit of trial and error I will soon cook the perfect chip with little or no oil!<br><br>The AirFryer works more as a mini oven than a fryer so since then I have tried various foods that I would normally grill or bake in the oven.  Marinated chicken with skin on came out succulent with crispy skin.  Fish fingers and nuggets were perfect.  The main advantage is its size - rather than heating a whole oven and the cost of that, you simply preheat the AirFryer for 3 mins and your food is cooked in approximately 3rd less time.  Although I have to admit the tray is not huge so you cannot cook mountains of food, it is still adequate for our small family.<br><br>This is definitely a kitchen gadget that will not sit in a cupboard gathering dust and I envisage using it regularly for health(ier), delicious food!", "hash" : "d404d7f1353757058cb19bb431744c6f", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Movielover1", "authorLocation" : "London", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/AACFZUG31FEL0/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b2bd55d62de700610174" } }

So if you really want to fry something, this won't help with that, but anything that you can heat up, roast or bake in an oven, you can do in this, and a bit quicker and more economically. I have cooked a small beef roast joint and it came out well - its a bit trial and error as to timings but if you take a few minutes off the standard oven timings it should be about right.<br><br>Chips. As many of the reviews point out, this is where the air fryer excels. I must admit I haven't been to the trouble of making fresh chips so can only comment on the frozen variety, but the first thing I did to try the machine out was throw a handful of frozen chips in and blast them for the recommended 12 mins......tried them and thought 'wow!' - best oven chips I've ever cooked. It's gets them very crisp and golden but nice inside. There are two key factors in producing a result like this. First is the timer; because you set a precise time, it's impossible to overcook (so easy to forget when using a regular oven). The other factor is the Quality of the chips. A lot depends on personal taste of course (whether you like your fries skinny, or thick, crinkled etc) but I would strongly recommend trying McCain Home fries, give it 12 mins on full heat setting and prepare to be amazed at how good oven chips can be. The Speed of cooking can be a real asset - or perhaps your downfall; from the moment you decide you suddenly fancy a bowl of chips, you can get them started in the ad break and 10 mins later you're eating them!<br><br>In practical terms, its well built and tries to look 'sleek' in its Design. You do need a suitable corner of your worktop to 'park it' but it wont look out of place in a smart kitchen as its kind of hi-tech looking. The drawer pulls straight out and the basket detaches at the press of a button, and both can be easily washed either in dishwasher or quite quickly in the sink. I think the simple timer control (just turn it to the amount of minutes you want) makes it really simple to operate - might make it an ideal gift for anyone who finds cooking a real challenge and cant deal with tricky gadgets. Whenever I have to use someone else's microwave - or cooker - i often struggle to work out what i'm doing and regret the passing of the simple timer controlled microwave control; this harks back to that, so its simple for all to use. Even your kids can now cook!<br><br>The price for this machine seems to vary quite a lot. From a fairly pricey RRP it was advertised  recently on tv (by a retail store) at a nicely discounted price. When I then checked on Amazon and Argos they had both matched that price, so thats when I got mine. I see now that the price has gone back up so worth comparing prices before buying.", "hash" : "e00393a2ffb395cb81425c2377493d4e", "channel" : "amazon.co.uk", "authorName" : "Roller Ed", "authorLocation" : "London", "authorLink" : "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A3V0SHDOG2TZSR/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp/276-9638689-5637336", "_id" : "5522b22755d62de7006100e6" } }

These machines were not cheap so I was reluctant to make the foray into another brand.  I finally had to when the vanes which turned the paddle on my last Actifry disappeared.

I thought it was far more robust than the acifry but I just didn't get the feeling that it would be as good, so I left it where it was.  How wrong can you be??<br>I was lucky to find one on Amazon that was on special offer. It was about £100, so I thought 'what the heck'<br>It is amazing.  Far stronger that the actifry and makes chips that are far superior.  It is also more versatile as you can cook all sorts of thing in it that you couldn't with the 'paddle' machines (e.g. baked eggs, baked cheese on toast etc.)<br>I would certainly recommend this machine over its competitors.  It is easy to clean as well.<br>The only downside I can think of is that its lack of paddle prevents parsnips from rolling up into a ball (which often got talked about at 'family gatherings for roast dinners), but I can live with that!<br>Highly recommended.

The airfryer genuinely offers a high level of convenience for someone who is rushed in the kitchen, doesn't like Cleaning the oven, or is looking for a healthier alternative to frying.  There are a couple of drawbacks to be wary of however.  It takes a few attempts to get used to cooking times, and the price for the same model fluctuates wildly depending on where you shop.<br><br>When starting out with the airfryer, put your food in at the lower end of the timescale printed on the instructions until you get used to how long it takes to cook things.  You can always add some time on after, because it only takes a minute or two to go from well cooked to incinerated.  I often make my own chips with it and it took a bit of practice to get the timing right.<br><br>Don't expect your chips to be as good as traditionally double-fried in beef dripping fare.  The way the airfryer pushes super-heated air around your food will make your chips crispy, but it also dries them out.  This is why you need to add a bit of oil to the chips if you're making your own (pre-bought oven chips are already coated with oil).  I like to spice my chips up a bit with chipotle infused oil and some five-spice.<br><br>Airfryer chips are easily better than those done in a normal oven, but the time taken to cook them will vary depending on how thick you've cut them.  I steamed some potatoes the other day, I changed my mind and wanted them crispy; so I chopped them into discs before coating them with a drizzle of oil and spices, then put them in the airfryer for 12 minutes or so, they came out great!<br><br>Anything that can be cooked in an oven can be cooked in the airfryer.  Again, it takes practice to get used to timings, and if you're cooking anything really greasy (the instruction manual says not to) keep a good eye on it and use common sense...super-heated air at 200 degrees with hot fat make for a smokey kitchen.<br><br>There must be something about the way the airfryer works that really locks in the flavour of meat compared to using a conventional oven. The burgers I did in mine were among the best I've tasted...and as my bathroom scales would tell you, I've eaten a lot of burgers!<br><br>The airfryer is relatively easy to clean, especially if you have a decent dishwasher (spouses are included in that statement).  The basket slides out and also separates, so you have the basket itself and the drip tray. It's much easier to clean than a deep fat fryer! Overall it's nicely designed and doesn't feel cheap even though the exterior is plastic.<br><br>Now, the kicker.  Watch what you expect to pay and do shop around if you decide to buy an airfryer.  I bought my one (the HD9220/20) for £89 only three weeks ago.  The exact same model is now selling for over £100 in the same shop (I like curry but couldn't buy it there), I also found that it's almost double the price I originally paid elsewhere!<br><br>I think Philips have realized they're onto a good thing and appear to be matching their prices with their Tefal competitors.

I mentioned this to a colleague who said the lid and paddle had some issues so I decided to see what alternatives there were. I've been a massive fan of Tefal I have the 4 in one Tefal slow cooker so I admit I was pretty disappointed.<br><br>I researched on customer reviews and countless utube videos I decided to get the Philips as I used to have a Philips juicer and it lasted for ages. Amazon was the cheapest price it's listed for £180 on the philips uk website.<br>I got it delivered next day. It was out of the box rinsed and switched on to use in less than 2 mins. First up chicken sausages and smiley faces no oil required. Done in 8 minutes. Normally I defrost and then heat my grill to very high to get the same effect. The box did look massive the actual size is ideal for a small kitchen. It came with a quick guide a recipe book with a helpful section at the back showing cooking times, temperatures and food types. It came with a chip guide also.  You do have to open the cooking drawer to give it a shake to prevent food from sticking at the bottom.<br>There are two dials at the front the timer (max time 30 mins) and the temperature (max temp 200). The drawer handle opens and there is your fryer tray the rest of the drawer is a drip tray non stick easy to clean. There is a button which easily releases from the drawer to load/unload food. My only gripe is the wire fryer insert could have been made more robust. I have tried to make a variety of foods before leaving a review and well I'm so impressed I'm tempted to purchase a second one. Now size I have to say if you have a family of 3+ get the XL one. For my family size it's fine. My daughter can be a fussy eater she knows what she likes and what she doesn't but this has been a hit with her too. Bonus.<br>The fryer is fast to heat up fast to cook in and it may take you some time to adjust cooking times to your preferred crispiness etc.<br>I have cooked all kinds of frozen foods in minutes. Homemade wholewheat samosa's, homemade healthy fried chicken, whole roast chicken. I would say due to the high heat cooking for fried chicken pieces soak in buttermilk or yogurt overnight it tenderises and leaves the chicken juicy inside even though you airfry it at such a high heat. Don't use vinegar/acidic marinades/lemon in any yogurt marinade it can dry out/toughen chicken. For the whole roast this doesn't require as high a heat with skin on brine overnight with rock salt water drain and leave to dry for a day in the fridge. Rub a little olive oil on the skin rock salt and chuck the whole thing in the fryer.  Fries are the best I've had for a long time.  I haven't owned an oil fryer for years so I have been using my oven.<br>It is faster than my fan assisted oven.<br>I have ordered the baking accessory from the uk Philips website as it was a wee bit cheaper than amazon. I'd like to try out a few more Recipes sweet and savoury. There are plenty of online Recipes I don't feel you need any airfryer cooking books.  I have attached some pictures on my review as to some of the foods I have cooked. It's made dinner times a lot quicker and easier than before. I was worried about the warping I read on one review but it seems it was 2 years ago and haven't felt it overheat etc. It must be an issue that's now resolved. I wanted a product that is going to last and I feel it was well worth the money. As we speak my tandoori chicken is marinating in the fridge for tomorrow's dinner '<br><br>Finally Cleaning it isn't a problem if you have a dishwasher you clean out the drip try and the fryer attachment which I have to admit is a pain as I don't have a dishwasher. I don't want oil stains on the fryer attachment so I soak it through and have to scrub it trying to be careful of the surrounding non stick container.

I just love it.  After a lot of research looking at both the Tefal and the Philips I decided on the Philips because it takes up less workspace than the Tefal and the price was better.  I have a small kitchen and appliances that get used regularly stay on the work top so it had to look good too.  A visitor came into the kitchen and said \"where is it then\" so it does fit in.<br><br>The cooking part - I wanted to be able to cook all sorts of stuff but not necessarily chips and this is where this shouldn't really be called a fryer because the list I wanted to cook includes crouisants, chicken, very low fat sausages and some other stuff.  My normal oven takes about 20 minutes to heat up and then six minutes to cook the crouisant.  The air fryer took a total of 8 minutes from start to finish.  The sausages have almost no fat in them and can easily take 15/20 minutes in a pan on the hob.  The air fryer had them cooked perfectly in 10 minutes.  Both at much reduced temperatures than the oven, too.  These are just a couple of examples of the things that you can do with this machine.  There are many more things that can be cooked including those chips and potatoes but as in all cooking, the timing and temperatures are rarely exact.  For instance, the crouisants recommended temperature is 200 degrees for six minutes.  The air fryer turns out to be 160 degrees for six minutes.  So the thing to do is cook it till it's ready (take it out and have a look) and don't necessary stick rigidly to the times and temperatures.<br><br>This purchase will be used a lot.

I have had mine for a month and find excuses to use it. If something like fries don't come out as crispy as you want (I have never had that problem, I saw a complaint about this somewhere else) turn it down a little and cook them longer. I always make frozen sweet potato fries in this which are a disaster to bake, even worse in the microwave but, with the airfryer they consistently come out crunchy on the outside and just right on the inside. Very professional. The footprint is exactly as you can imagine in the pictures, not any larger than some stand mixers but round instead of oblong.

This is not a fryer but a mini convection oven and it performs similarly to other convection ovens, majority of which are far more versatile and are selling for less.<br><br>I got mine as a gift. It is the version that sells in Canada and it does not come with food separator or baking dish. With retail price over $200, you'd expect these things to be included.<br><br>How well does it perform? It makes decent baked fries in about 20-25 mins. The results do not compare to a deep fryer in terms of taste, but then this appliance should be compared to other convection ovens and not to deep fryers. While baking is healthier than deep frying, the notion of \"guilt-free chips/fries\" is fallacious as the main problem with potatoes in general is their starch content. It breaks down into sugar and messes up your brain receptors that signal you to stop eating because you're full. I can't believe people still fall for this low fat nonsense. If you're watching your weight, you should be more concerned about grains and sugar.<br><br>Other items I tried in it were salmon fillets (about 10 mins, results identical to baking salmon in conventional oven) and raw sausages (10 mins, again, same as baked). With raw sausages, right at the end of the cooking cycle, the smoke coming out of the back became very intense and set off my smoke detector. It's a good idea to keep an eye on your foods if they have higher fat content.<br><br>Don't expect to feed a crowd using this convection oven. It will cook enough food to feed 2-3 people. 4+ means you have to cook in batches so the time savings go out of the window, you're better off using your conventional oven.<br><br>The appliance is mostly hard plastic. It feels solid. Cooking basket is metal with some type of Teflon/non-stick coating. Cleaning has been problem-free so far. Similar to any other non-stick pan.<br><br>A special shout-out goes to the Philips marketing dept:<br><br>1) \"Air Fryer\" is an oxymoron. Dictionary defines frying as cooking in oil. \"Air frying\" and \"rapid air technology\" are known as convection baking outside the Philips headquarters. There is nothing \"revolutionary\" about them.<br><br>2) \"Healthy\", \"healthier\" and \"guilt-free\" is plastered all over the box. Healthier than what? Deep fryers? Sure. Other convection ovens? No.<br>*Speaking of \"healthy\". Philips conveniently does not mention whether the basket's Teflon coating contains toxic materials or whether the plastics in close proximity to food contain BPA.<br><br>3) \"Oil free cooking\" is an outright lie and one of the Philips ads mentioning it was banned in the UK. Their excuse was that frozen packaged chips/fries already have oil in them so it doesn't count. By that logic, I can enjoy oil free cooking in my cast-iron frypan if I get somebody else to put in there. Brilliant! Not that there's anything wrong with adding good Quality and healthy olive oil to your baked food.<br><br>In conclusion, it is very hard to recommend this small convection oven at this price point. You are far better off spending $100-150 on a larger and more versatile convection oven from Cuisinart, Breville or Panasonic. Or, if you're comfortable with slightly longer cooking times, just stick with your conventional oven. It \"air fries\" your food just as well.<br><br>*Extra star taken off for deceptive marketing.<br><br>**It turned out to be difficult to find objective reviews of this product on the web.

It comes with a cooking manual which is for the most part helpful and accurate, but it also depends a bit on trial and error. You may have to add additional time by a minute or two if you are making large chicken breasts or extra thick pork chops. It also won't make food in large batches but can handle a small family's needs.<br>Frozen french fries aren't particularly impressive, but if you dredge them in a couple of tablespoons of cooking oil and turn on the unit the results are surprisingly good. My advice is to experiment in small increment and use the oil sparingly as needed. This does an excellent job on frozen chicken tenders and pre-made onion rings. For the most part I use frozen foods because convenience is my middle name, but you can also do made from scratch fried foods with decent results from the cook book.<br>One important thing to note is you shouldn't reuse oil because it gets rancid and/or retains particles from old oil and will make the oil less than appealing and it may also smoke.<br>I purchased this from a shopping network and paid less by fifty or more dollars. After a few months of use I still have yet to encounter any problems with the AirFryer.<br>I like it because it is a healthier alternative to oil saturated fried food and is quick and convenient.

I've read multiple reviews prior to purchasing and knew what I was getting into prior to its arrival, and was able to try a few things out to make my own conclusions. Also there are many more reviews from the UK/Australia, but I use the US version and have cooking times in farenheit etc.<br><br>Things you need to know:<br>1. This item is best suited to cook frozen fries and other frozen foods. It does this job well. The fries taste similar to what can be done from a deep fryer, and definitely better then a regular conventional oven (though I dont use \"convection baking\", so I cant speak to its comparison with convection)<br><br>2. Its built well and easy to clean up. Compared to deep frying, there is a night and day difference. No mess, minimal smell (as much as normal cooking)<br><br>3. Its size is not as big as people may make you think, its smaller than a Kitchenaid mixer. Also in terms of noise, its not silent but if you are alone without background noise (music or TV), there is the noise of the fan which is noticeable, but not a problem<br><br>4. This is ideal for 1-2 up to 3 people for snacks. You cannot feed a family without doing multiple batches. The amount of fries that can be cooked at one time seems to be the same as two medium orders at a fast food chain.<br><br>What I have cooked:<br>Frozen fries - great, as advertised<br><br>Frozen samosas (Indian savory pastry) - initially turned out ok initially without any manipulation, but brushed with some olive oil prior to cooking and turned out great, similar to frying<br><br>Frozen popcorn chicken - great<br><br>Fresh Chicken wings - this is what sold me on this machine. Just take fresh wings from the grocery store and brush with some olive oil, cook for 18 minutes on 350-390 with a shake half way, plate and pour on your favorite warmed wing sauce. Definitely as good as doing it in the deep fryer in terms of crisp on on the outside and tender inside, superior to baking as well (conventional baking). However, this does create some smoke but if you pour out the oil (the extra oil just from the chicken itself that comes from cooking) at the time you shake you will avoid the smoke. This makes 8 wings easily, could probably make 12 easily as well without stacking. and I am also thinking of getting the layering rack when the price goes down.<br><br>In regards to home made fries - i have not tried this, and it seems like it would be time consuming based off the various Recipes because of all the soaking etc that you need to do. Also wet batters dont seem like they would work well in this either.<br><br>Overall, I think this is a good product and best suited for 1-2 people who are looking for easy ways to cook frozen foods that turn out as good and way less oil compared to deep frying, and would be great for kids who want to eat frozen foods and maintain that high Quality crunch. Some foods you cannot substitute for deep frying, and there is a whole range of items of fresh foods that I have not tried yet due to time constraints. However, the price point remains high for this product, and think that it would sell better if it was around $150.<br><br>Feel free to ask my questions etc, and am excited to see all the various items I can make in this machine.

The food was equally as crispy as our local bar snacks and I didn't use a drop of oil or butter! I couldn't believe it. I was really impressed and can't believe how easy it is to clean it too! One small negative comment I would say is that I put the nuggets at the bottom of the basket and when I tried to remove them, a small bit of breading got stuck between the holes. That is really the only small complaint I have. Overall this thing cooks/air fries awesome! I'm really pleased with my purchase.<br><br>There are only two adults in my household, so this size is perfect. If you have more members in your family, this might be too small but I'd say for two-four people, its perfect!<br><br>The only reason I gave it four stars versus five is because to get the full value out of the machine, due to the price, you have to buy several other Accessories.

Stack", "channel" : "amazon.com", "hash" : "bd1d5b246a3766eee15d212899c08cb0", "html" : "When I first reviewed this I liked it very much and pointed out it had many more uses than just french fries. In particular I said most frozen breaded food like chicken nuggets, breaded fish, etc. came out perfectly from a frozen state. I have since had excellent results using it on fresh food from everything to raw chicken to breaded raw pork chops. The key think to keep in mind is not to cook raw food with enough fat in it to start dripping. I cook very thick pork chops by coating in flour and browning on my cooktop. But if I leave them on the cooktop the flour will burn before the center is cooked. Once the chops or fish or chicken is browned enough, not real brown, I transfer them to the hot pot for about 8-10 minutes depending on thickness. Of course this is the same as putting them in a preheated oven but this way there is no preheating and the turbo fast hot air makes the coating even crisper without browning it further.The big limitation is size. I am only cooking for one or two but if you are cooking for four or more you will have to use your oveb. I have also had good luck with raw fish, chicken breasts, etc. without a lot of fat by nust seasoning it and putting it in the fryer for 10 minutes or so. If you season it and spray a little Pam or olive oil on it it will come out browned and juicy on the inside since the shuper hot fast moving air will put a nice brown crust on it. Now back to original review.<br><br>Hot air fryers are fairly new in the US. When I set out to buy one there was only one available on amazon and it was not the Phillips so I bought a less expensive model that was OK but when I finally to buy a Phillips I did (for $320). Most of the ones available then were not name brands and not available on amazon. The difference between a hot air fryer and a convection oven is the turbo speed it passes the hot air over the food.  If you leave your blow fryer on your head for an extra 10 seconds without moving it you will get the idea. It does cook fries almost as good as deep frying (you are missing the delicious oil) but it cooks almost any frozen breaded food like fish, chicken pieces, shrimp, etc. It also cooks many fresh foods like fish, seafood, etc.You need to look at the cookbook to get ideas. I have not put any raw fatty foods like a hamburg in it but I have cooked lean steaks. If you are mainly interested in fries the main competitor is the actifry which I have had for years. The actifry will also cook other foods but they have to be small to tumble over the turner hump and they burn easily since it only has one temperature-hot.<br>  There are over 300 reviews for the avtifry so you have all you need to know about actifry. It is an innovative product that will cook many different foods you would normally fry at hot temp. while stirring. You don't need to stir with the actifry but you do need to keep an eye on it since it is high temp. only and it is easy to burn foods. For deep frying french fries it is a great alternative but has not had any competition until now. The hot air fryers (not pots) are becoming available and popular right now and also make french fries without deep frying. There are many opinions on the internet about which are better, split about 50/50 on fries. But the new (to the US) hot air fryers also do many things besides fries. They have a basket much like a deep fryer so do not stir the food. But you can put large food like a chicken breast, frozen or not, breaded or not, and get excellent results. Almost any breaded meat or fish can be cooked to perfection. It takes a while to figure out the timing. Best of all it has a temperature control so if you are not trying to get the deep fried look like on unbreaded fish, you can turn the temp. down and get fried fish. So which is better? If you have food no larger than french fries that need high heat and constant stirring to keep from burning the actifry is usually the best. If you have large pieces of meat, fish, etc. you can't put them in an actifry but the hot air fryer will do an excellent job. I rate both 5 stars and since they are about the same for fries but otherwise cook different types of food you need both! If the pieces are small and need stirring the actifry is the way to go. Disadvantage is no temperature control.<br>  Foods larger than fries cook in the hot air fryer. It cannot hold as much food as the actifry but is adequate and the only option for larger food you would fry or deep fry but are too big for the actifry. Notice the actifry has come down in price since it was introduced. But it was patented so had no rivals. The hot air fryers are made by many although the Phillips was the first one I saw. It cost $320 a month ago. There are 3 alternatives on amazon now ranging from $150 to $250. Amazon also has the best price on the actifry. So go crazy and order both. They will greatly cut down your time in the kitchen and do not heat the kitchen up. I live alone so I prepare the food, put the entree in the hot air fryer, the side dish in the actifry and maybe one other dish in the microwave. Then I watch TV until dinner is done in about 10 minutes for most meals. For the truly lazy get a fuzzy logic rice cooker as well for when you are tired of potatoes. Amazon has a nice selection. You might spend as much as $500 but your slaving over a hot stove will be over. The hot air fryers have been popular in Japan, China and Europe for a while but are new to the US.<br>SUMMARY Actifry is excellent for fries and can cook many other foods as long as they are not much bigger than fries or homes fries. The continuous stirring keeps food from burning but the high heat (about 400 degrees Is my guess) will still burn some delicate foods. Many reviewers sound like they only use it for fries which is a shame. Timing varies with the amount of food. Main disadvantage--no temperature control.<br>  Hot Air Fryer also cooks excellent fries but in my opinion the Actifry fries are slightly better. I think this is because you use a tablespoon of oil in the actifry which eventually coats all the fries and helps them brown. If you spray the fries with oil before putting them in the hot air fryer they are about the same. The hot air fryer will cook many larger foods like chicken breasts, bratwurst,whole potatoes, entree size meat and fish with or without breading although frozen breaded works best Main disadvantage--medium deep fryer size basket will not cook enough for four but you can keep the first batch in an oven set a about 150 degrees. Main advantage is a temp. control allows you to cook more delicate foods like unbreaded fish.<br>If I could only buy one, I cannot say for sure which I would buy. I do use the hot air fryer more just because so many entrees cook in it.<br>  At this price it is a real bargain and Phillips is the gold standard and the first name brand to sell in the US.", "language" : "us", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T17:56:23.752Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/product-reviews/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_9?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=all_formats&filterByStar=all_stars&pageNumber=9#ajax-page25", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/dp/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.com/gp/review/RAZ0OPTA8SL87/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7N43UA", "pubDate" : "2014-02-08T23:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "total" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.com", "subtitle" : "Deep Fried Taste And More Versatile with each use", "title" : "Philips HD9220/26 AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black", "votes" : { "total" : 11, "positiveVotes" : 7 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

I admit I am a fan of most Phillips products, they put time and effort into Design, and end user satisfaction. Certainly not inexpensive, but REALLY GOOD at what it does.<br><br>I will not get into Health benefits ( or lack there of) but I can tell you it is beyond simple to use, and cooking results have been OUTSTANDING! From fast fries, to shrimp, salmon, and mozzarella sticks this is a winner!<br><br>On Television and Movie sets, we have catered food, and \"craft service\" to provide things all day( and NIGHT, sometimes). I first saw the Philips unit used on-set for a popular cable TV drama, and loved it.  I went out , and got one.<br><br>Considering the results and ease of use, I brought it to my senior parents, for a try-out.  To be fair, I did not know what to expect. Mom is almost 80, and was a sensational intuitive cook, but suffers from severe vision impairment, now. Dad is suddenly the cook ( or buyer of prepared food).<br><br>Once I explained the  product to them, there was interest.<br><br>After we cooked a few things, there was joy!  Mom, in particular liked the notion that she could prepare some of the things that were once staples - fries, mozzarella sticks, hash browns, onion rings (YEAH Mom!) with Safety and ease.  We even made \"string-bean\" fries that I saw on-set once.<br><br>Needless to say, Mom and Dad kept the unit, and are happy! I know it can be hard to get gifts for people at any age, but do consider this, as an option.  I feel this is best designed unit on the market, and it delights people. Priceless!<br><br>And, yes, after giving one to Mom and Dad , I DID get another one, for me, and almost use it daily. This is really top-of-the-line, and worth every cent. Comfort food just became EASY!<br><br>**** Update Aug 9 2014 ******<br><br>The units are still going strong and are used several times a week-- so this is not one of those \"use it a few times\" kind of things.<br><br>Terrific for \"popcorn\" shrimp and chicken! Really nice after a long day at work, and you want something good and easy to prepare. Mom and Dad love theirs too, and say they use it 4 or 5 times a week - that's outstanding!.<br><br>They even planted string beans this year to use with the Air-Fryer. De-LISH!<br><br>I come back to the ease of use, particularly for seniors (or maybe college age people?) This is a safe and reasonably healthy way to enjoy comfort food. The Philips build is great, as you would expect. I have had no problems, nor have my parents. Ultra high Quality.

I was very excited to get it.....then I used it :( . Most of the stuff you are going to watch online is from Europe, Australia, and Asia. It looks like you can fit a lot of food in it. The reason is because their baskets overseas are bigger then the ones released in the US.  They get all the good stuff in their box like the food separator an the dish pan. We here in the US DO NOT! What you see is what you get. Just the basket, that is it, nothing else, oh well u do get the cook book but that's about it. In order to get your fries the right consistency you basically end up with somewhat burned food. Now maybe lowering the temp might help but honestly after using my actifry I didn't even want to bother with this piece of junk. ironically the pan to catch the grease is non stick but the basket is not!! I just laugh inside when I think about this, how dumb......your food will stick to the basket. Oh and the simple shake in between cooking?! kind of hard when the food is stuck to the basket. I bet they did a lot of takes to get that perfect shake on their add. Oh!!!! I tried to cook foods with a bit of fat and the darn thing started smoking out the back!!!! my smoke detectors were going off like crazy!!! I'm just not dealing with this thing. I was hoping to use it in conjunction with the actifry but nope i'm sending this thing back. Maybe the newer digital model has worked out the kinks but this model is a no no. I highly suggest you try with the newer model or get an actifry. but the thing that really upsets me is I love this concept...I was going to use this for my dry battered foods as with the actiry it stirs so batter comes off I really wish this product was made like the ones overseas. They look like they are having grand old time with their model and we get stuck with a overpriced piece of crap :(.", "language" : "us", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T17:56:15.276Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/product-reviews/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_2?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=all_formats&filterByStar=all_stars&pageNumber=2#ajax-page18", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/dp/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R36VO8WYAKA3FL/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7N43UA", "pubDate" : "2014-04-23T22:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "total" : 5, "value" : 1 }, "source" : "amazon.com", "subtitle" : "WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!", "title" : "Philips HD9220/26 AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black", "votes" : { "total" : 67, "positiveVotes" : 51 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

I've put frozen chicken wings in for 12 minutes, and they've come out fully cooked and crispy. Same with vegetables.

This was a good purchase for me, and although maybe the reviewer is right who says the Breville portable convection oven is a better buy, the Breville is too big for the space I have and it costs more.  (The smallest Breville is not convection). Quibbling about whether it's really a fryer seems useless to me.  Technically the food is not fried, and that's good.  It tastes pretty close to fried and as a Southerner I'm an expert.  I have cooked several things in it now, but have not tried baking yet. Although it takes a little getting used to, it is not as tricky as a microwave and it's very forgiving.  Basically you coat the food with a teaspoon or two of oil, put it in the basket and cook it.  Air blows across it constantly.  I had wondered about foods with a batter, and it is possible to \"fry\" those also.  The batter or whatever will drip to the bottom at first, so a light coating is best. I have put oil on the food but I don't see why you couldn't cook without any.  All but the motor can go in the dishwasher but it's easy enough to swipe it out by hand as it's bulky.  I bought mine on a shopping channel so that I could try it out without committing the whole purchase price, and so far I'm glad I did.  It would not be good for a large family as the food would have to cook in batches, although it could be done.  It could be improved with a temperature monitor of some sort so I would know when it's preheated adequately and when it had heated adequately after the drawer was opened.", "language" : "us", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T17:56:14.154Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/product-reviews/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_17?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=all_formats&filterByStar=all_stars&pageNumber=1#ajax-page17", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/dp/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R3O4YATJWVOMFT/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7N43UA", "pubDate" : "2014-06-28T22:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "total" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.com", "subtitle" : "Close enough to fried for this Texan", "title" : "Philips HD9220/26 AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black", "votes" : { "total" : 96, "positiveVotes" : 87 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

I was skeptical at first based on other's reviews.  But I have learned in the past that you can't make everyone happy.  We bought this just about a month ago and have made a variety of things in it.  We have made batter dipped homemade onion rings, that were really good - over cooked which was our fault - but very good. We have made store bought frozen French Fries which turned out really good and we have made homemade Lumpia (a Pilipino spring roll) in this thing.  The Lumpia was a little dry, but tasted great.  It is a little dry because it is not soaked in oil!!!  It takes time to get used to the cooking times as it is mostly trial and error... we are still figuring that out but have been very pleased.  I think people need to remember that because there is no oil, the food will taste slightly different... as in you will have the ability to actually taste the flavors of the food not the oil.  I highly recommend this as it does make crispy food with a 'soft' center. This is great for anyone who is trying to cut back on the grease, i.e. people with heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc.  Or just anyone who would like to lose weight and be healthier.<br>Do seriously consider buying the cooking rack insert, especially if you have more than 2 or 3 people in the house, it double the cooking area and works great - yes we bought that too!", "language" : "us", "lastUpdate" : "2015-04-06T17:56:25.075Z", "link" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/product-reviews/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_10?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=all_formats&filterByStar=all_stars&pageNumber=10#ajax-page26", "linkToProductPage" : "http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9220-26-AirFryer-Technology/dp/B00D7N43UA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8", "linkToSingleReview" : "http://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R2CFFH3UEU7NSN/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7N43UA", "pubDate" : "2014-08-22T22:00:00.000Z", "rating" : { "total" : 5, "value" : 5 }, "source" : "amazon.com", "subtitle" : "I really love this!", "title" : "Philips HD9220/26 AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black", "votes" : { "total" : 2, "positiveVotes" : 1 }, "keywords" : [], "normalizedProductInfos" : [], "productNames" : [], "categories" : [], "pros" : null, "cons" : null } }

They're a solid company with a well-earned reputation for Quality products.  This is not one of those, in my experience.  It has a critical weak point, and until they fix that, I strongly suggest you don't buy this product.  I unpacked this brand-new item, and proceeded to explore its features.  To wash the product, you must detach the basket-handle from the basket.  I pushed on the flimsy grey plastic release button, and attempted to detach.  Nothing happened.  I applied a slight amount of torque, equal to what you would use to twist off a bottle cap from a beer bottle.  Immediately I heard a \"snap\" and noticed that the entire joint had become damaged, flopping around like a broken limb.  Seriously?  It broke, after such a slight application of force?  I examined it closely and noted that the only connecting points were tiny little plastic nubs, which had broken off. There was no illustration in the enclosed user's guide instructing how to remove the handle, whether to twist like screw, or pull up, or down. Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  The fact that this critical connecting piece is so poorly constructed of cheap plastic as to break under very little pressure gives me a feeling of little confidence in the engineering of this product.

Why?  Because this one is much tougher to clean.  I think they Philips calls it Rapid Air Technology, basically it's grooves in the bottom that are supposed to direct the air upwards.  Well, those grooves make this a pain in the butt to clean.  My previous Air Fryer, a cheap knockoff, had a flat bottom.  I notice no difference in cooking, but I find this harder to clean.  Both of them get messy inside and aren't as easy to clean as they could be, but this one is more difficult.<br><br>That being said, do I love Air Frying?  Absolutely.  It's great for a single person to eat healthy and cheap.  I throw a frozen pork chop or chicken breast in the fryer, sprinkle a little seasoning salt on top, set it for 20 minutes, go about my business, and dinner is ready.  No microwave, no drivethrough, and relatively cheap.  My friends laugh because none of them have ever heard of Air Fryers, and I talk about mine all the time.<br><br>All in all, would I buy this one again.  Yes I would.

I did find it hard to believe that it could actually cook more quickly and efficiently than my convection oven.  The first day I tried roasting some broccoli in it.  This would normally take 20 to 30 minutes in my steamer, or a good 30+ minutes in the convection oven.  I was totally skeptical when I pulled out the broccoli and it was perfectly roasted in about 12 minutes.  I figured it could NOT possibly be cooked through and would be raw in the middle, but I was wrong!  It was cooked perfectly all the way through and had a perfect crispy golden crust on it.  Even my husband liked it and he usually hates my roasted broccoli, because i have to practically burn the outside before the middle gets cooked in my convection oven.  The next thing I tried was roasted green beans, and ham and cheese melts.  Again, everything was perfectly done and took only minutes!  I only cook for my husband and I, but cooking usually takes so much time that I end up cooking a lot of casseroles, etc. on the weekend so we will have leftovers during the week.  But with the air fryer, its so easy to whip up a meal within a few minutes that I don't mind cooking smaller amounts for each meal.  Tonight I made stuffed peppers, first I cooked the meatballs -- they were perfectly done, crispy on outside and cooked through within about 12-15 minutes, so I stuffed them in the peppers with a little cheese and roasted them a few more minutes.  The peppers were cooked perfectly, not too crispy and not too mushy, and they were delicious.  The air fryer reminds of a microwave in how quickly it cooks, but it also crisps & roasts everything perfectly, too!  Its totally amazing and I'm really glad I got it!!  I thought about getting the new larger version, but when I measured it I quickly realized it would be much too large for our tiny kitchen, and this one fits perfectly.
